## Setting and relevance

The book is set in a speculative future -- approximately 500 years in the future. After social and environmental collapse, a new social structure has arisen.  This small mountain town is a critical part of the story, as one of the key centers of this new government. Travel is very slow (foot, bicycle, horse) so news from other areas is infrequent.  The people of this world attach a high degree of importance to place -- often religious -- and so setting is very important. 

The Delvers are a religious cult with substantial power in the region. They control who has access to magic, to education, and they use their magic as a form of subtle mind control to keep the population happy and committed to them. Originally founded as a utopian commune, factions have begun to form that go against the original goals of the Delvers: Harmony above all. Harmony is a multifaceted concept they use for almost everything they value.

Key locations include the Delver compound (known as the Well) and the sacred spring.
