# nano2017

Hi. I will flesh this out as I go along but here is what you need to know to begin with: 

This repo is holding the "novel" I'm writing for NaNoWriMo 2017 [https://nanowrimo.org].

(I tried to make that ascii dragon look better in markdown but you know what, it looks like junk. And that's something you'll have to get used to around here, so I'm leaving it.)


Should you choose to read along, be forewarned: 
* Characters will pop up, disappear, change gender, have new names, develop new motivations at the slightest breeze, become different people altogether, merge into one another, split into two or three, and more. 
* There will be typos. Paragraphs will turn into long self-cheerleading diatribes.  
* Scenes may disappear at any time. 
* It's going to be really f*(@ng bad. 

If you eat artistic process for breakfast, lunch and dinner, then c'mon in and make yourself at home. 

## Why would anyone post first drafts on the internet. 
1. It just kind of seems like a cool open-source-adjacent idea? 
2. I wrote a bunch of poems live this summer and that went really well. Please note: this project will involve literally no editing, unlike the summer poems. 
3. I've done NaNo before; I'm curious to find out how publicly sharing my work will affect how I work. 
4. Once I thought of sharing it publicly, the only reason I could think of for *not* sharing is that the writing will be an embarrassment. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts as I go along. If you like using github, then dig in.  If you don't, find me on Twitter https://www.twitter.com/sparklingrobots or Instagram https://www.instagram.com/sparklingrobots or just my very regular blog at http://www.tara-king.com.
