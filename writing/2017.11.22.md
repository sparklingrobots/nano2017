[Council of Delvers]

Here is what we know so far. 

We won't cover what we learned from your excellent book on the subject.  But we believe there was a song used over the years to cleanse the tree, sort of. We don't know if it was a song of protection or removal.  We have a few songs in our records of songs from the group of Watchers, but none of them seem to be quite right. 

We think there may have been another entity involved, someone who was corrupting the watchers until they finally fell into ruin.  It seems like perhaps we have been lucky that nothing has happened before this--or perhaps Fi caused it by Delving the tree itself.  We don't know.  We've never encountered anything like this--a sentient tree, maybe. A powerful spell set on the tree, perhaps.  But we have members of every Well within a 500 mile radius and they all have had problems starting the night of Fi's vision. 

Lo waited.  "I'm sorry but, really? A vision? That's what we're going on here."

Un glanced at the oldest person at the table. They nodded. 

"Lo, what we're about to tell you is known only to Delvers. If you share this information outside the Delvers, well, we don't know what will happen to you but we know that it would bring ruin to the Delvers."

"We've been engaged in a multigenerational program of selecting extraordinarily sensitive people and training them to use those senses in ways that normal humans are not able to. And, while we don't force anything, we encourage marriage and child-rearing among Delvers who wish to do so to increase the sensitivity of our kind even further.

Over the centuries of doing this work, we've found some extraordinarily talented individuals--and we've learned to trust their instincts.  The information they sense manifests in strange ways, as visions that are sometimes literal and sometimes simply a warning processed into a more abstract form by their subconscious.  And each of these Delvers tends to specialize in certain ways.  Fi's specialty is, was..." they paused "plant-related. From a young age they were an exceptional gardener, able to heal almost any unhappy plant. They used to report stories from the plants, and gradually we've been able to hone it into a very powerful ability.

"So, yes. Yes, we are going off a vision. It's what we've done for centuries and it's what we'll continue to do."

Lo glanced at Fi, who looked at her directly now that she had glasses on. She remembered the dark visions she had received from Fi the first time they'd met. Lo looked at Un, and then scanned the Council slowly. 

"You want me to find a song."

"We want you to find a song and we want you to sing it at the site of the tree. We can't risk any more Delvers going there.  Bring in the damaged Delvers."

Two figures emerged from the far side of the room, guided benevolently by an older person.  They seemed to struggle to walk in a straight line; the guide held each by a shoulder and walked slowly to keep them relatively on track.  They wore a different color of robe and very large reflective goggles. 

"Fi came back unable to properly Delve and to connect people.  These two..." Un sounded truly sad for the first time.  "These two are now dangerous, with the skill of a Delver but they seem infected by a desire to disrupt and scare people instead of bringing us together. They...they nearly caused some discord here at the Well before Fi realized what was happening.

"We think this may be what happened to the missing Delvers. We don't have proof that it did, but the type of reports we're getting from the communities where they went missing show bizarrely clicquish, tribal behavior.  The sort of thing Delvers are trained to prevent. So now we're spreading from the healthy wells out to the weakened ones, trying to stop the spread of this...virus and we can't risk any more good Delvers at the spring. We need you, Lo.

It was the second time this week Lo had heard anything other than serenity and unity from the mouth of a Delver.

He didn't go to the Well again. 

He could barely remember the strange vision of the night (?) before, only knew that he felt uncomfortable when he tried to think of that night or what came before. 

He felt lonely.  And angry.

When his neighbor came to borrow a book, he invited them in for tea.  They joined, glad to spend a bit of time with a friend.  And then he did what he wanted--he unfurled his abilities and pushed a little bit of fear into them as they talked about the Delver they'd seen that day, singing to a little girl on the side of the road.  He enjoyed watching their posture change as his emotions colored their own.  He'd always been good, so subtle that most people didn't notice the work he was doing on them.  

He went for a walk the next day.  He went to the market, felt the weaving of all the people coming and going, the knots formed everytime two people spoke--asking the price of two silvery fish, saying hello.  

He felt the Delver approach long before they got to the market.  He didn't have much time, so he took off his glasses and looked into the eyes of a passing parent with their child.  He encouraged them with his look to fear their child.  He could see them clasping the child's hand more closely.
