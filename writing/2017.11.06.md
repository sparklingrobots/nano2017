_What happened to neighborhoods when the cars went away. Everything was far apart, how much work it took to get everything.  they had to mourn the fact that they coudlnt' go to Ikea in Burbank anymore, with an aside about how this was before IKEA became what it is now (mystery!) 

How much they felt like they got trapped in these shitty neighborhoods.  How they eventually realized that this is just their shitty life now.  How much it was like a hurricane but on a grand scale.   

That's when the change happened. _

The cars went away gradually at first.  It happened more or less the "free market way" (a concept Lo struggled with in school).  Gas prices kept rising so people started driving less and less. Even the government stockpiles and subsidies weren't enough.  

It was way, way too slow for the polar bears though.  And the ice caps.  All told they estimated that global warming killed some 12,000,000 species.  It was also the end of free market capitalism and fossil fuels.  It was the end of Ferrari and American car culture, for better or worse.  

One of Lo's favorite laments was a threnody, really.  A threnody to the open road.  A threnody to the feeling of an engien shifting beneath you, to the pleasures of getting somewhere at top speed, whenever you wanted to.  Stopping by the side of the road and feeling the rush of the traffic along the freeway behind you.   To be truthful, she found this particular song a bit terrifying but it was also so keening and sad.  

In general she found the old times sad--she watched video clips of movies and the way people were pushed aside during a foot chase or cars were just thrown off a cliff with no regard for the occupants just because they weren't the star--it gave her a dark chill. 

But anyway, back to the history: 

People started driving less and less and then out of the blue there just wasn't any more gas, at least not in America. They had kept the secret very well.  One day the gas station owners were expecting a delivery and it just wouldn't come.  Depending on where you were in the supply chain you may have gotten an extra couple weeks but most of the small towns in the middle of America ran out first.  Nobody in the large cities paid much attention at first so they weren't any more prepared when their own end came.  In about three weeks it was over. 

Some large companies still had stockpiles for their fleets, so for a while business was stronger than ever.
