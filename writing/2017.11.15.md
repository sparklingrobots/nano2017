He had a small bag with him, tied to his waistband.  She had to give him credit for walking quietly.

Okay, maybe she doesn't watch him approach.  Sorry, hapless reader. 

He swung wide around the tree and approached from the side away from the mission, trying to keep the tree between them so he wouldn't be spotted.  He walked with bent knees quickly and silently up to the tree, then crouched in the shadow side, moonlight falling on both sides of him.  He pulled the tool they gave him out of its bag--a device to bore into the heart of the tree.  He felt along the bark for a good place to begin and found a relatively smooth section of bark.  He pressed the borer up against the tree and started turning the crank.  He was grateful that it didn't squeak but it wasn't exactly silent as it drilled a hole an inch across and ten inches deep in this young tree. 

He worked quickly.  A noise came from above, like a wounded man, and he dropped the tool to the dirt.  He stayed crouched, putting his hands on the smooth bark and craned up to see if someone was in the tree.  It was dark.  He squinted against the bright moon but couldn't see anything--no movement, no strange shapes.  He could hear only the sighing of the branches, and smell the fresh sawdust from the tree and the fresh vegetation around the tree. 

He waited a few moments for his hands to steady.  He picked up the tool from the dust and finished boring the hole.  Then, from the back he kept around his neck, he pulled the vial.  He hadn't looked at it since they had given it to him, though he frequently felt the outline of it in the bag.  They hadn't told him what would happen if it broke. He had not asked. 

The vial looked fine. Unable to resist his curiosity, he held it out into the moonlight to see it better. The plain gray dust inside went from dull to iridescent, and as before it seemed as if there was almost a pattern in the dust.  It almost looked like words but he couldn't read this language. He felt his entire body go cold and snatched the vial back into the shadows.  The letters disappeared. 

He turned back to the tree and carefully placed the vial in the hole he had made for it.   He pulled the other vial from the bag at his waist--a tree protectant.  He stuck his finger in the opening and the thick green liquid coated his finger.  It smelled like something he'd never smelt before, camphorous and strong.  He rubbed the liquid in the hole as far as he could, especially around the opening.  Then he cut the bark off the wood he had bored out, and settled it in the tree, a little camouflage.  

He was excited now.  He'd finally done it.  That future of whores and ladies, gold and blood was upon him, or would be.  He could stop worrying about this life, this worthless fake mission--

She came up fast behind him and pinned him to the tree.  She had been on patrol and he managed to come up when she was gone.  Honestly luck is better than skill--there was no way he'd managed this on purpose.   


"What are you doing, senor?"

He smiled, despite the knife at his neck.  

She eased away from him, keeping her knife at the ready.  They had never killed at the spring and she'd like to keep it that way. 

"What are you doing, senor?" Her deference from earlier was gone completely and now he could see it was an act.  This woman had killed before and would again.  Even though he knew he'd get his reward, one way or another, she did seem to be something of an obstacle. 

She scanned the tree and while her eyes were off him, he gripped the borer in his hand, ready to use it against her.  But the knife at his throat kept him pinned. 

"Nada, senora. No hago nada. Solamente estoy [praying] en la sombra del arbol sagrado." 

"El arbol no es sagrado. Solamente el agua es."

His eyes flickered to the tree, afraid he'd done the wrong thing and she took that opportunity to pull him off his feet away from the tree.  But he was not new at this and as she pulled him her guard was done, and he slammed the cutting edge of the borer into her neck.  Blood fountained from the wound and he took pleasure in her eyes widening for him until her knife slid up and under his ribs. 

She hadn't really meant to do that.  She didn't like killing but a deep part of her brain had taken over with a desire to live and to retaliate.  Her hand was firmly pressing into him still but as he staggered and released the grip on the borer she stepped back and felt the tool stuck in her neck.  She knew this was the end. She wanted to drag him and his foul blood away from the water. She reached to grab his boot and tried to pull, but felt her grasp fail.  She fell to her knees and crawled to the edge of the water, the water she had given her life to protect.  She reached a hand into the blue pool, lit so well by the moon she could see the small fish sleeping there. She reached out and saw the blood on her hand washed away by the water.  She had not failed.

The next watcher found the bodies as the sun was coming up.  She ran to tell the others.  They would need to fix this tonight. 

# TODO: Finish Su's scene.

(Note to self why do all of my scenes involve someone stealthing around.  WHY NOT COMBAT!? WHY NOT ACTION!? WHY NOT DIRECT CONFRONTATION!? I do not know the answer, hapless reader. I do not know.)

Su knew she was supposed to go to the library for that book Lo needed.  But she also knew something was not right about this strange trio who had parked their car on the freeway to hide it and were now strolling nonchalantly down the street together.  She parked her bike in an alleyway and started walking after them. 

Two of them were smaller, the third taller.  Maybe six feet tall.  They might not have seemed suspicious but seeing them in a car was enough to get Su's attention regardless.  The one on the left wore a long dress, a soft jersey knit type thing that fell to the tops of her shoes, and a blue sweater over the top.  The one in the middle wore jeans and a t-shirt, a striped shirt, and a wool hat.  The one on teh right, the tall one, wore some kind of coverall.  They looked like they were dressed for different kinds of weather, even.  She followed along at a distance, then decided to go around the block and see if she could get a good look at their faces by passing directly next to them.  

She picked up her pace and jogged quickly to the right, then down an alley and took a quick left, only to nearly run into them. 

"What the fuck" snarled the one in the hat. 

"Whoa, sorry, didn't know you were there."

"Watch where you're fucking going, [slur] [not sold on this]"

The word was so old Su almost didn't recognize it.  The person who said it seemed shocked it had come out of her mouth but -- almost pleasantly so.  Like she didn't realize she could be so terrible. 

"This is Bad Guys turf, twinkie. I wouldn't hang around here no more." 

Su blinked in shock.
