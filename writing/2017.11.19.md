TODO: Write about the social technology that holds this all together. It's obviously tied up in the singing, meditating, and maybe something else. There's a strain of some magic, maybe, with the delvers.  

The Great Mourning finally took both sides of the political divide.  

It took awile for the young people to be tired enough. Instead of the ongoing refreshing energy from the young people, they were tired. Everyone was tired. Nobody was encouraging anybody to do anything.  They stopped reading the news. 

This is not working for me today.

So you're one of the Delvers. 

Fi nodded. Lo tried to keep a presentable face.  The Delvers made her a bit uncomfortable, sort of a wish to be more like them and also knowledge that they led a very different life from the rest of us. They were important and powerful and weird as fuck. 

The Delvers were a highly specialized group of people who inherited the highest levels of knowledge around the stability technologies, and in some way were responsible for maintaining them. During the Great Mourning, or rather immediately after, and for several hundred years, humanity had recalibrated, somewhat organically towards kindness, survival, and prosperity on a biological level, rather than towards progress in a capitalist sense.  Science was still important but rather than trying to find an enzyme to dissolve the last bits of fossil fuels from their traps underground, a lot of science turned toward how to be better people.  What they learned was that in large part there were certain technologies that helped people align with each other, increased empathy, and generally made the species more stable.  They studied bees and other colony-based animals.  Bees did not, generally fight amongst themselves.  (We will skip, for now, the protracted battles over whether or not humans were meant to be separated into levels, to say only that the answer was no.)

The Delvers knew a lot of things that Lo did not about singing and how and why they sang so much.  The Delvers also had slightly different nervous systems tha the rest of the species--they tended to be more sensitive to physical stimuli, with very large eyes.  Nothing you might notice on the street, but when you saw a group of them together, there was something extraordinarily beautiful about the experience--serene beings with their big, shining eyes, watching all as they moved and making small adjustments to keep everyone aligned.  A smile here, a helping hand, and something Lo couldn't quite explain.  They didn't *speak* to you in your mind, not exactly, but something about them helped her feel calm.  [What she doesn't know but I don't want to forget is that thing that people can do with the sympathetic nervous system.  Essentially they're able to modulate other people's emotions through very advanced levels of what we already do: breath control, pupil dilation, pulse rate, and perhaps something a bit magical.  Maybe chemicals or homones they can choose to release.] That's why they were called Delvers--it was like they could reach inside you and find what they were looking for. 

Delvers were chosen at childbirth and trained in secluded facilities off in the wilderness.  It was an honor to give birth to one, and when the training was done they would come back to live in the community they came from, for the most part.  And they led many of the bigger songs with the community, deciding when and where it would happen.  They were known to stand on the street corner and sing long songs about something happening in the community--about the work that goes into keeping the street clean and neat, about a parent caring for a child, or a child caring for a parent, about long lost mournings from that part of the world.  Not everyone stayed to watch, but Lo frequently did, as part of her general studies. 

As a kid she'd been frustrated that she hadn't been chosen as a Delver (no doubt the cause of her unease as an adult though I'm not sure we need to say that right at this moment).  She loved music and singing so much, and the Delvers knew all the songs.  Her parents were always having to drag her off from watching them as they sang, carrying her in their arms as she cried--cried until the Delvers invariably did their thing and helped her calm down.  But it was one of the few walls she had in her life--the feeling of separation from the Delvers.  When she first went to school, her teacher asked her about her dreams for her life and she said matter of factly that she'd like to be a Delver when she grew up.  The teacher had laughed, which made the other kids laugh, and Lo was embarrassed without knowing why. 

That night her parents sat her down and explained about the Delvers, that she was too late to go, they only take babies and they didn't take her.  She heard them but resolved privately to make them take her.  She'd learn fast.  She sang well already.  

But, as we can all tell, they never came for her. As she got older she came to understand that they had physical abilities she did not--and she also learned that in many ways to be a Delver was to live a role of service your entire life.  You didn't get to have a family, or lovers--at least not the way anybody else did.  And you were responsible for the emotions of so many, many people.  

So, she became an amateur historian of the music and the songs. She taught them in her spare time [TODO: Do any of them have jobs and if so, what are they?]
