Something about the way they said void had made her tremble--her stomach heaving. Her vision blacked out in the center of her eyes. The song was still reverberating in the large honeycomb shaped hall when her vision returned. 

Un felt for Lo, but also knew she was not someone to pity.  They had read her records, and it was clear she would be able to handle herself--well, no one could really handle themselves around the Delvers but she would be fine.  Still, only occasionally and with great preparation for the other had they ever done what they just did to Lo: a concentrated blast of gratitude wrapped around a core of fear and anxiety.  The fact that she was still standing showed her mettle.  Un was intrigued, to sya the least. 

"Lo, good to see you this morning." Un called out to her across the hall. "Join us, if you will."

Lo walked over to Un, hoping she looked more level than she felt.  "Quite a greeting you all put together."

A quiet round of laughter moved around the table as the Council moved to put their sunglasses back on and took their seats.  Lo smiled as she sat down.  She would not let them put her off. She would resist their powers as much as she could. 

[does lo have a special ability to retreat inside herself? does she know that she has it or is it instinctive?]

A person across the table stood up.  They were also tall--they looked perhaps like a sibling or close relative of Un.  Lo assumed the Delvers were genetically different from the general population so perhaps it was logical for them to look alike. "We are here because of a grave threat to the Delvers. We believe you'll be able to help us."

"Forgive me if I don't introduce all of us.  We needed everyone here for...well, reasons you'll come to see.  I trust Fi told you the basics?"

"They told me that something happened regarding that old tree out by the springs, and that it had...infected or damaged some of your Delvers. They said you needed help with the history of the area." 

"Indeed.  Fi came back damaged but relatively healthy.  The other two Delvers came back burned out.  They can no longer Delve, nor can they Receive."

They paused and looked around the council. Early morning light streamed through the windows onto the table and Lo wondered if she could get some coffee.

"We have things to tell you about the Delvers that non-Delvers are not allowed to know, but without this information you "

Actually maybe not. Maybe they withhold the info and that becomes part of the conflict.  

"We would like to send you to the tree to see "

"We have heard reports from distant Wells that some of their Delvers have disappeared. The "

TODO: This Council of Delvers scene is a mess and I don't know where to go with it.

Un, Zo and Mq sat in a small room of the Well together.  Fi was there, too, off to the side.  Un would have to sort out what to do with Fi and the other damaged ones--they made the Delvers uncomfortable and that kind of tension would not be good for the community as a whole.  But they couldn't simply eject Fi, either.  Bad for morale. 

Zo cleared their throat, "You called us here to talk about the situation?"

Un nodded. "There are many things going on.  First, we have our damaged Delvers here." Zo glanced unintentionally at Fi and saw them cringe away from the attention. "Second, we need to remove the threat of the tree. And third, we need to figure out if this has anything to do with the greater problems with Delvers in the region."

"I have some ideas about the second one," Zo started. Zo's role as community organizer [need a better title] meant she knew a lot about the area and the people who lived there. "There's a woman named Lo who writes books about the area--she's knowledgeable and well connected. If anyone is going to know something special about that tree, she is where I'd start."

"We obviously can't send any more Delvers, not after the way the last one came back," Mq responded gruffly. 

"She's not a Delver--she's just another person. I've only met her once or twice, but I reviewed her book on the area before she published it and found her quite insightful."

"What's her full name?" Mq asked. Mq's specialty as a delver was to test new born babies to see if they would be a good fit for the Delvers. It had been quite a while since Mq had done the tests themselves--now a gray-haired and rugged faced person, Mq was responsible for training and overseeing the corps of Finders. They pulled up their book of names. 

"Lo Ana Iquy."

Mq began flipping through the book, cross-referencing their enormous storage cavern's organizational scheme. "Fi, fetch me this file, if you would." Mq scrawled a ten digit number on a note card and passed it over. 

"In the mean time, I have reports of more Delvers going missing. We haven't lost any here but there seems to be a handful of Wells suffering from missing Delvers and....other disturbing incidents."

"You think it's related?"

"The timing is incredibly suspicious. I've sent envoys to each Well reporting missing Delvers to tell them what we experienced. I don't trust it by mail."

[stuff happens, or maybe the file is brought in with them]

Fi returned with the file, put it on the table and returned to their seat on the side of the room. 

Mq opened the file and started scanning. Un could see something interesting was presenting itself by the way Mq's eyes opened slightly.  

"I don't think she's a good choice." Mq said, still lost in the file. 

Un arched an eyebrow and waited.  

"She has...a strange history.  We tested her as a baby and I thought at first she would be perfect for us.  She's got a strong voice and memory for the songs, but there's something about her...we brought her here and although she was very well behaved, there was something...off.  The nursery was disrupted the entire time she was here. We had to send her home."

"Is that all? It hardly seems enough to say no in this case."

"Another Delver had a vision about her.  They awoke from it in a fit, screaming 'Beware the King of All Birds'. 

TODO: Describe the vision.

TODO: Decide what they will and won't tell Lo. 


[Note: Zo probably isn't the one who helps when Lo arrives]
