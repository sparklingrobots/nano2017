The next day she tried to visit the tree and found the fence locked. 


Write about how they locked it up and kept it locked up--this is the forest they are hiding from her. 



THINGS THAT GOT LOST: 

The history of the tree, the way the strangeness of the tree in its context obscured from her that true strangeness about it.  Something is hiding in this tree and she needs to know what.  (Alternatively she gets offed and somebody else figures it all out.)

Su riding a motorcycle to get to the library. She takes the freeway because it's less obvious. She loves riding. Describe the beautiful day she experiences.  She sees a car ahead and gets spooked. Only the gov't uses cars now and only for ceremonial purposes.  She tails them, watches them park it under a tree and start walking away. TOwards the library.

The way the lessons from the Great Mourning are immortalized in songs now, so she knows them. And maybe she's just part of a cult? Rather than this being teh same as everything.

What happened to neighborhoods when the cars went away. Everything was far apart, how much work it took to get everything.  they had to mourn the fact that they coudlnt' go to Ikea in Burbank anymore, with an aside about how this was before IKEA became what it is now (mystery!) 

How much they felt like they got trapped in these shitty neighborhoods.  How they eventually realized that this is just their shitty life now.  How much it was like a hurricane but on a grand scale.   

That's when the change happened.
