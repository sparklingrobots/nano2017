# OUR HERO

## WHO'S THE HERO

Okay, how do we have a hero when the whole concept is a world without a strong sense of heroes? 

This actually isn't that hard to understand. People make nobodies into stars all the time.  They don't have to be raised up in front of all in the book world to have a grand struggle on the world stage or whatever.  Think of Flora 717.  A hero if ever I saw one, from a communal world and very much dedicated to that world.  

Given the theme, the hero needs a connection to history which is why she's an academic/historian of some kind.  She is perhaps also a botanist.  An ethnobotanist? A historian of ethnobotany?  That sounds hard and also who does that job anyway.  Maybe it's just her hobby and not her real life. 

The puzzle will need to be surrounding the issue of the ethnobotany. Things that have crossed my mind: The forest scenes in Stranger Things (e.g. another universe touching ours), the Northern Reach trilogy (e.g. a menacing and inhuman threat)


## WHAT ARE THE TWO CONFLICTING NEEDS OF THE PROTAGONIST

She desperately needs to know the truth and/or to make sure the truth comes to light.  

BUT she also needs to survive, preferably with her loved ones intact (is that a thing you can 'prefer'? Isn't it a need at this point?)

OKAY. 

She desperately needs to know the truth and bring it to light.  

But she needs to survive as part of an intact community/family.  

## WHAT MAKES THE STAR THE STAR

She is the star.  She is the star because she is uniquely able to pull everyone out of the morass with her, she is the center of gravity of this group, people are drawn to her and always have been.  

If the story is a big blanket stretched out tight, she is a weight rolling around on it.  (That's a weird metaphor from dance making.)

# BAD STUFF

## WHAT IS THE JEOPARDY

The jeopardy is her two conflicting needs.  She will be forced to choose.  Perhaps in her choosing she can outwit the villain and get them both--but in her heart she will know that she has to make a choice.  

(Flora 717's two needs were to survive, which entailed fitting in, and to be the unique and magical bee she knew she was.  She didn't get them--but she did get to survive in that weird parenting way.  And she definitely was the unique and magical bee.  In some ways her needs (though she didn't know them) (how interesting is that!?!?) were to save the hive and to destroy the hive.  And she saved the hive by destroying it.)

(Damn.)

That feels almost right for this story, but I'm writing visionary fiction and the world I'm drawing 

## WHO'S THE VILLAIN

## WHAT IS THE MONSTER?

Monsters in gardening include: 
* Animals that eat everything
* Poisons
* Drought
* Mold
* Bugs 
* Floods/natural disasters

Monsters in history include: 
* Mold
* Decay
* Loss
* Disruptive events that destroy records
* Disinterest
* Fallibility of memory

Mold is an obvious overlap here.  Mold as it grows from small spores, a treacherous threat that works, I suppose in much the way that this culture works--communally, collectively, piece by small piece, transforming into something good (to the mold). 

## HOW DO WE KEEP THE MONSTER FRONT AND CENTER IN ACT TWO?


## WHAT ARE THE STAKES

The stakes are huge--the whole society. Not sure how yet. 

## WHAT IS THE VILLAIN SPEECH

# OVERVIEW

## WHAT'S THE COUNTER THEME

This one is fascinating.  In a world like the one I envision, what is the counter theme? If the theme is something like: we can grow together into a stronger species, what is the opposite theme? What will be the ongoing struggle in the other direction? Or will there be a crisis? There has to be a crisis or this book will really be terrible. 

## WHAT IS THE INCITING INCIDENT?

The inciting incident is one of two things: 

Either our star becomes aware of some information that disrupts their sense of equilibrium and joy--some deeply threatening information that either needs to be kept secret or that needs to be brought to light (at great social cost, I'm guessing). 

OR

There's an inciting incident from the outside.  A new generation of babies is born unable to connect with each other.  A force from outside (another planet?) comes in and fucks shit up.  Animals gain the ability to speak to us and turns out they are huge dicks.  I don't know. 

ALSO 

Don't forget that bad things can just happen. 

The inciting incident is the afternoon with the tree. I don't know what it incites yet, but that's the moment. 

## WHAT IS THE EMBEDDED CLIMAX?

I don't remember what an embedded climax is meant to be. But here's the thing I think it is: 

The bad thing (whatever the bad thing is) must be brought into the culture, must be digested by it and transformed. 

Could the bad thing threaten the tree? 

Be the tree? 
 
Be inside the tree? 

## WHAT'S THE CLIMAX

How do we have a gardening related climax? It sounds so boring and slow. Why did I do this to myself. 

## WHAT'S THE CONCEPT

## HOW DO THE CHARACTERS REPRESENT THAT CONCEPT?

## WHAT'S THE GENRE

I'm thinking like... a visionary mystery novel.  An informational mystery novel. 

Unsurprisingly Snow Crash continue to point the way but I can't put my finger on how.  

IT'S A THRILLER!! DUH.  This is always what I write (that's a lie) but it's totally a thriller. I love reading thrillers but they're all full of ridiculous men and women treated like trash.  I want a thriller that can happen in a world I want to live in and FOR FUCK'S SAKE I want a thriller with a feminine/female/nb protagonist, this shit shouldn't be that hard and NOBODY GETS TO FUCKING SWOOP IN AND SAVE HER. 

## WHAT'S THE THEME

The theme has something to do with: 

History and how we care for it

The Great Mourning is a period of loss and letting prized things/beings/experiences slip into the past gracefully. Then understanding that things will die and we are here to help the dead decay and feed the living. 

We let the GM fix a lot of things about our eocological problems.  We are still, however, a species with conflict and desire and ambition.   

# The theme is death, maybe.  History & gardening.  

## WHAT IS THE SETTING 

North American city in ruins? Deciduous foresty place.  Highways are gone.
