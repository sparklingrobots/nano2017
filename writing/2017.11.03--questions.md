## WHAT IS THE INCITING INCIDENT?

The inciting incident is one of two things: 

Either our star becomes aware of some information that disrupts their sense of equilibrium and joy--some deeply threatening information that either needs to be kept secret or that needs to be brought to light (at great social cost, I'm guessing). 

OR

There's an inciting incident from the outside.  A new generation of babies is born unable to connect with each other.  A force from outside (another planet?) comes in and fucks shit up.  Animals gain the ability to speak to us and turns out they are huge dicks.  I don't know. 

## WHAT IS THE EMBEDDED CLIMAX?

## WHAT IS THE MONSTER?

Monsters in gardening include: 
* Animals that eat everything
* Poisons
* Drought
* Mold
* Bugs 
* Floods/natural disasters

Monsters in history include: 
* Mold
* Decay
* Loss
* Disruptive events that destroy records
* Disinterest
* Fallibility of memory

## HOW DO WE KEEP THE MONSTER FRONT AND CENTER IN ACT TWO?

## WHAT'S THE CONCEPT

## HOW DO THE CHARACTERS REPRESENT THAT CONCEPT?


## WHAT'S THE GENRE

I'm thinking like... a visionary mystery novel.  An informational mystery novel. 

Unsurprisingly Snow Crash continue to point the way but I can't put my finger on how.  

## WHAT'S THE THEME

The theme has something to do with: 

History and how we care for it

The Great Mourning is a period of loss and letting prized things/beings/experiences slip into the past gracefully. Then understanding that things will die and we are here to help the dead decay and feed the living.  

# The theme is death, maybe.  History & gardening.  

## WHAT'S THE CLIMAX

How do we have a gardening related climax? It sounds so boring and slow. Why did I do this to myself. 

## WHO'S THE HERO

Okay, how do we have a hero when the whole concept is a world without a strong sense of heroes? 

This actually isn't that hard to understand. People make nobodies into stars all the time.  They don't have to be raised up in front of all in the book world to have a grand struggle on the world stage or whatever.  

Given the theme, the hero needs a connection to history which is why she's an academic/historian of some kind.

## WHAT ARE THE STAKES

## WHAT IS THE JEOPARDY

## WHAT MAKES THE STAR THE STAR

## WHAT IS THE VILLAIN SPEECH

## WHAT'S THE COUNTER THEME

This one is fascinating.  In a world like the one I envision, what is the counter theme? If the theme is something like: we can grow together into a stronger species, what is the opposite theme? What will be the ongoing struggle in the other direction? Or will there be a crisis? There has to be a crisis or this book will really be terrible.
