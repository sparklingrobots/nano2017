The elevator broke.  This is new and I'm immediately trying not to worry to find the best way out of the situation. I turn to look at the woman in the elevator to judge her reaction. She's calmly sizing up the situation, near as I can tell, and not terribly concerned about me.  She's about 6 feet tall--bigger than me--and has a short haircut, curly, very dark hair.  Her eyes are large, but so are all her features.  She is not very expressive so it's hard for me to know what's going on with her. 

"Looks like we're stuck." I say. 

"Mmmm".

Not a talker.  Okay, I don't need to talk either.  I consider the buttons.  I press the already-lit button for the fourteenth floor but nothing happens.  

"We're not going anywhere." She says. 

I laugh to break the tension.  "So it seems."

"You don't like to make direct statements, do you?"

I'm taken aback and purse my lips, putting on my "I'm thinking face". "I suppose not."

"See?"

I laugh and am surprised when she laughs as well. "Most people don't realize how much they hedge. Sorry to be so rude." 

"No worries, really."  I begin to think maybe I'm trapped in the elevator with someone interesting, at the least. "I'm Tara, I work here. How about you?"

"I'm Lo.  I was coming to visit a friend who works here--do you know Su?"

"The long brown haired one?" 

"No, they have short hair, they work in janitorial."

"Sorry, no." 

We wait for a long moment. 

"Ever been stuck in an elevator before?" I ask. 

"No, I've only rarely been in one."

"I take them every day."

"What do you do here?"

"I maintain the archives."

"Mmm, interesting." She seems to be warming to me, finally.  "You know, I've been looking for someone to interview about that.  We're a bit stuck here, waht do you think?"

"Interview for what?"

"I'm writing a song about how we keep the archives, how we save them as time moves forward.  Just sort of a pet project."

"Well, sure....I guess we might as well."

She pulls a notebook out of her bag and sits on the floor.  Wanna join me? It might be more comfortable"

I sit cross-legged on the floor--the first moment I remember there are about 12 stories of empty air below us.  

"It is what it is, isn't it?" she says.  It's a bit more cryptic than I'm used to but I nod and laugh. 

"It is."

"Okay, so, Tara, how is it to keep the archives?"

"Well, the biggest "

[This feels a bit elaborate and not a lot helpful. Thanks anyway writing exercise. ]

A few hours later she was asleep beneath the tree. Her head ached but she was exhausted--unable to summon the wash of rage from earlier.  She was defeated. She had been defeated. She had been rejected and now here she was, errand boy for the victors.  

She looked up at the tree and saw another opening beginning to drip sap.  And she realized there was something new happening. 

There were birds.  There were birds in the branches, birds on the ground, birds in the nearby tree.  There was a bird on the small rock next to the sprint.  Sparrows, swallows, crows, even a hummingbird, a flycatcher, and a few geese.  They were silent.  They were watching her.  

She looked behind herself and realized they had surrounded her entirely.  She scrambled to get her back against the trunk of the tree.  

They sang together, all at once. Not the same song, but a song: A chaotic trumpeting, a mass of chirps and trills and honks all at once. She stood up, bracing herself against the tree.  

A crow flew down from the tree and landed in front of her.  It cawed, a single plaintive squawk and then it pitched forward, opening its wings wide to her, head down to the ground.  She didn't move. 

The other birds lined up near the crow, behind the crow, and started adopting the same posture.  

They were bowing to her. 

She felt compelled to return the gesture and executed something like she'd seen in old movies--a courtly bow, leg extended to the front.  She felt as much as she heard the birds start to depart while she was down, and by the time she straightened the last few birds were lifting off and flying away. 

This was not what she had expected.

When she got back to the apartment Fi was waiting.  They sat on the couch, drawing pictures of plants--an aloe vera, an exotic looking plant covered in spines and round bulbs.  Fi looked up and dropped the pencil. 

"Lo I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told you."

"You needed to tell me. I needed to know. I'm becoming who I am, I can feel that, and nobody knows quite what that means."

Fi didn't respond to that. 

"Fi I need to know what happened."

"I don't know the details, it was before my time obviously.  All I know is they took you in from your parents and there were...troubles.  There were troubles with the other babies.  The nursery couldn't control you by delving, so they sent you home.  I don't think they've ever done that before."

"That's it. They just sent my home."

"I don't know; you can tell as well as I can that I'm not very important to them. I assumed your parents had told you. Mq is scared of you; Un seems...Un seems intrigued."

"They never said anything. It was literally the only thing I ever wanted, to be part of the Delvers. It was..." Lo stopped. She was tired of reliving this loss after the day she'd had and the ... the thing with the birds. 

"So what was this dream of yours?"

"You were at the Well.  You were singing--not like a baby sings, more like a talented child. And a bird...a bird came out of your mouth. A crow.  It hovered above you as you sang, and then it flew away. And...the Delver nurses came in and called you King of All Birds."

"King of All Birds? What is that?"

"It's probably nothing; I've never heard it before. Just some weird dream shit."

Lo's face sagged. This was going to be harder than she ever anticipated. But it wasn't time to tell Fi what had just happened at the spring.
