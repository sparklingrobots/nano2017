The elevator broke.  This is new and I'm immediately trying not to worry to find the best way out of the situation. I turn to look at the woman in the elevator to judge her reaction. She's calmly sizing up the situation, near as I can tell, and not terribly concerned about me.  She's about 6 feet tall--bigger than me--and has a short haircut, curly, very dark hair.  Her eyes are large, but so are all her features.  She is not very expressive so it's hard for me to know what's going on with her. 

"Looks like we're stuck." I say. 

"Mmmm".

Not a talker.  Okay, I don't need to talk either.  I consider the buttons.  I press the already-lit button for the fourteenth floor but nothing happens.  

"We're not going anywhere." She says. 

I laugh to break the tension.  "So it seems."

"You don't like to make direct statements, do you?"

I'm taken aback and purse my lips, putting on my "I'm thinking face". "I suppose not."

"See?"

I laugh and am surprised when she laughs as well. "Most people don't realize how much they hedge. Sorry to be so rude." 

"No worries, really."  I begin to think maybe I'm trapped in the elevator with someone interesting, at the least. "I'm Tara, I work here. How about you?"

"I'm Lo.  I was coming to visit a friend who works here--do you know Su?"

"The long brown haired one?" 

"No, they have short hair, they work in janitorial."

"Sorry, no." 

We wait for a long moment. 

"Ever been stuck in an elevator before?" I ask. 

"No, I've only rarely been in one."

"I take them every day."

"What do you do here?"

"I maintain the archives."

"Mmm, interesting." She seems to be warming to me, finally.  "You know, I've been looking for someone to interview about that.  We're a bit stuck here, waht do you think?"

"Interview for what?"

"I'm writing a song about how we keep the archives, how we save them as time moves forward.  Just sort of a pet project."

"Well, sure....I guess we might as well."

She pulls a notebook out of her bag and sits on the floor.  Wanna join me? It might be more comfortable"

I sit cross-legged on the floor--the first moment I remember there are about 12 stories of empty air below us.  

"It is what it is, isn't it?" she says.  It's a bit more cryptic than I'm used to but I nod and laugh. 

"It is."

"Okay, so, Tara, how is it to keep the archives?"

"Well, the biggest "

[This feels a bit elaborate and not a lot helpful. Thanks anyway writing exercise. ]
