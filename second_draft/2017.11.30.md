Let's write about how the song comes together: 

The next morning when Lo woke up she could hear a bird singing outside her window. She could also hear someone cooking in the kitchen.  ""

"Good morning, Fi."

"I hope you don't mind that I made breakfast for us. I figured we have a lot to do."

Fi's eternal helpfulness was slightly unnerving.  Lo was used to a communal spirit, but Fi's energy was boundless when it came to helping others. 

"Sure."  Lo grabbed her notebook.  "Okay, so what do we have?"

"We have the original vision." Fi spoke quickly and quietly on that. 

"Describe it to me again, Fi." 

"Okay, so, I felt the...intrusion in the tree, and then, like I blinked and woke up somewhere else, I was at the tree but everything was different.  The tree was alive but also on fire. I was there and I was in a circle around the tree.  A circle of ..." they paused to think.  "Six people." 

"You're sure it was six?" 

"Yes, it was six.  We all wore some strange kind of robes, and we were singing to the tree."

"Do you remember any part of the song?" Lo tried not to push too hard. 

"I....I can try. I don't have the best voice."

"Nonsense, all I need is what you have."

Fi sang quietly and hesitantly. The melody was not familiar to Lo. 

_Stay with us, grow tall with us._
_Two lines, one reward._

The two lines were separated by a few bars without words. 

"Does this mean anything to you, Fi? These words, or this melody? Do you know them?"

"Well, the..." it was still a struggle for her to speak of the Delvers' secrets here with Lo. "The melody is one of our most sacred songs, or close to it, at least."

Lo wrote furiously in her notebook.  "Sing the Delver song for me, please." she said curtly as she wrote. 

Fi wanted to protest but Lo's manner was so brusque she didn't feel she could.  So she started singing, a bit more confidently: 

_We heal with us, we grow with us._
_One line, one reward._ 
_Other bastardized lines that indicate they are trying to hard._

"When do you sing this song?"

"We sing it altogether as a sort of protection for the Well.  We surround..." Fi trailed off. They hadn't made the connection to how they circled the Well the way the vision had circled the Tree.  "It's a kind of...a spell for protection, and also a spell for fortitude." 

"Interesting. Everyone sings it?"

"Ideally we're all there, all the living Delvers of that Well.  But most of the time one or two people can't make it.  It's considered...bad form to miss very often.  You need a good excuse."

"When do you sing it, like what time of year? How often?"

"We sing it on all the holy days.  And sometimes if something bad happens, like if an important Delver dies. Or..." Fi stopped. "Well, those are the main times we use it."

"What else can you tell me about it?"

Fi looked off to the side, something Lo could only barely see with the reflective glasses.  

"I hate that song."

Lo waited.

"I hate singing that song; it's one of my least favorite things to do as a Delver." After a long pause, Fi resumed. "It feels....wrong somehow.  It feels fake and weird. Not how the song felt in my vision; that felt powerful and a little scary.  The song I know feels like...it feels like it was translated to another language and then back to English.  But it's so important that no one will even acknowledge that it might be weird.  All the Wells have their own songs, their own most powerful songs, I don't know the others.  But this one is ours and something just doesn't seem right to me about."

Lo tapped the paper with the back of her pen.  

"Have you ever had a vision like this before?"

Fi's extremely pale cheeks flushed a deep splotchy red when Lo asked.  "No, not like that.  I have visions a lot though, it's the only thing I have that's special."

"I can tell when the plants are thirsty, or need shade.  I can basically talk to them, but not in words. I can just sink into the soil and the root structure and...I don't know, it just makes sense to me what I should do next."  

"And sometimes I can see things the plant has 'seen', if you will." The flush in Fi's cheeks deepened. "But never anything like this.  It's like a little flash or short movie.  This was like...it was like the real world disappeared entirely. It was like I time travelled or something." 

"What kinds of things have you seen?"

"Just, you  know, things that happened in the garden.  Conversations, or whatever."

Lo felt suspicious but didn't push harder. [NOTE: Fi totally saw somebody from the Delvers, a powerful Delver, having sex with another student. Possibly coercive sex, almost certainly not ok given power differentials. And she felt both disgusted and envious.  She never told anybody but it formed the seed from which her fear and distaste of her fellow Delvers erupted.]

"Okay, so. We have six people, singing to the tree. A song you know but you don't know.  "

"And the robes."  

"What were the robes like? Did they seem important?"

Fi gestured at the notepad and Lo passed it over.  Fi started drawing--they were clearly not a visual artist but the idea got across.  Long red things, lots of flowing lightweight fabric, with a curious symbol on the back of it.  

"Did they all have this symbol?"

"I could only see the back of one...one of the singers came to the tree itself, stopped singing....and then finally they turned around and went back to their place.  So when they walked back I could see the symbol."

Fi hopped up to get the breakfast before it started to burn.  As they scooped the browned sweet potatoes and eggs onto Lo's plain brown plates, they did not speak. 

Lo was looking for the crack.  She needed to have the right question, the right theory--something to guide her search. 

Fi slid a plate in front of her and waited. 

"Do you have any theories, Fi?" Sometimes it was easiest to just ask. 

"I think...I got the sense that the song was a sort of protection or containment song. I got the sense that these people would sing it to the tree to keep that...thing inside of it.  Whatever it is that's inside that tree.

"And I think if we could do that song again, I think it would help contain...whatever it is that's going on."

I know someday you'll be the star in somebody else's sky, but why can't it be mine?

The tree had a spore in it that came loose when Fi psychically jostled it.  It infected mostly Delvers, who were vulnerable to the signals.  Those Delvers started to get stuck, resentful, isolated, and started turning people to their side. 

The song that Fi saw is indeed a containment spell that has been perverted/forgotten & rewritten by the Delvers in the area, but they don't remember any more where it came from.  So they sing it to the Well instead of the tree. 

The birds in the area know something of the tree.  They know that of the two lines of humans (Delvers & non) they will merge into one better species.  They know that Lo is the one to do it becuase they recognize her from her ancestor/reincarnated self, which is why they declare her King of All Birds. 

The Delvers want to broadcast their fucked up and vaguely fascist views longer distance. So they resurrect an old radio station and start pirate broadcasting.  This is where Lo breaks in at the end of the book and has to disable the device (in retrospect everything about that scene should be Su.  Su is more mechanical and will want to save Io but will not feel SO fucked up by it.)

In the mean time Lo has assembled her group to sing to the tree.  The singing will actually trigger a kind of collapse of the space/time continuum, so all the Protectors will be singing at the same time (why does this one trigger and no other time does?).  And when they do that, the tree will push out the antidote to the Bad Guys.  

But they don't solve it in time to save the Delvers.  And the Bad Guys have proven that this kind of secretive culture & structure is too dangerous.  So Lo knows her next phase in life is teaching the Delver skills to everyoe.  

The pale guy is one of the Delvers who gets turned first.  Io turns somehow but that part is still really sketchy. 

TODO: Write more of Io before they turn. 

TODO: Lo or Fi has a dream whre they get to practice something that they are struggling with in real life. 

TODO: Write about Fi being summoned back to the Well for the death of a despised but necessary mentor. Or their mom.

It took Fi most of her adulthood to realize that she didn't actually love Un.  The idea that they had to love Un, all of them, the whole Well, had been hammered in from the start. Un protects the Well. Un taught hte Well. Un is the center of the Well.  But then she started to realize what it meant to love.  It meant asking questions.  It meant paying attention and expressing affection. It meant noticing.  Un never noticed Fi, not in a good way.

In some ways Fi couldn't believe how long it had taken them to realize that Un saw them as a mere tick in the ledger sheet, another piece of evidence in tribute to Un's own greatness.  Fi, themselves, didn't truly matter, at all.  In fact it seemed Fi had two purposes: Feed the Well, and fuck up.  If they fucked up, they actually got more attention from Un.  It was the only time Fi felt particularly close to Un, when they knew Un was muttering under their breath about Fi's mistakes, just as they'd heard Un do dozens of times when other Delvers did something bad or wrong.  

Mq would tell Fi that Un loved them.  Un talked about them all the time.  Fi felt a bit silly but they didn't believe a word of it. 

So when the message came, Fi felt pulled out to sea and flooded at the same time. 

"Lo, I....I have to go back to the Well."

"What's up?"

"They....they need me there. For a ceremony."

"I need you here, Fi.  I need you.  We're so close and...you saw the message on the bench."

Fi turned her head.  "I know. I know you need me and I know we need to work but I..."  They put their hands over their eyes. There were no tears forthcoming but they felt like there should be.  They wished they would come. 

"I don't have a choice, Lo."

Lo was furious.  She was scared and Fi was the only one she had left, since Su left on the radio mission. 

"You always have a choice, Fi.  You alsways have a choice."

Lo turned and walked out of the apartment.  That's when the tears came.

As Fi pedaled to the Well, that same familiar dilation and narrowing happening at the same time, their body seemed to evaporate as their soul condensed into a thick sludge, they refused to think about the options.  They just kept pedalling.  The trees were gorgeous and the sunset was remarkable--the sky a slightly gray blue with bright streaks of coral clouds in front, and the moon hanging large in the midst. The trees were barren now, the leaves all on the ground, so only the black branches reached into the colors of the sky. 

They pulled over at the little rest area, at the bottom of the valley.  Their legs were tired--not a good sign at the bottom of the valley, with the climb yet to come.  

They sat at the table and made a quick sandwich to snack on.  They loved this part of the journey, the ritualistic snacks, the wide open sky with the surprising clouds. They loved the solitude.  They loved, in some way, the Well.  It was where they'd been made, in all truth, for better or worse...without the gardens at the Well, would they ever have developed the talent with plants? 

They wondered if they would die at the Well, or if their body would have to be transported there.  

Lo's words came unbidden: "You always have a choice."

Fi laughed to herself.  Lo was right, but Lo also wasn't a Delver.  Lo didn't know what it was like.  Lo didn't have to feel the crushing emotional pressure when she didn't live up to their desires. 

But Lo could have been. Lo was sensitive. And Lo managed to say no. [TODO: Figure out a time when Lo denied the Delvers.]

Fi looked at the moon. They imagined the ceremony going on without them, and realized that they truly didn't matter.  Un would never know.  Mq may or may not know.  But now that she couldn't delve anyway, what difference did it make? 

Fi got on her bike and headed back toward Lo.  There was one place they were needed. And they would be there.

TODO: Fi needs to realize that the work they're doing will destroy the Delvers and go through with it anyway.
