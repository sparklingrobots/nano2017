## Tara's Kinda Rough Plot Summary to Just Figure Out If I Know What Happens In This Book Chronologically

Centuries ago, a man was sent on a mission to the New World--to embed a sonic weapon in a sacred place that would accomplish WHAT EXACTLY. 

Modern times: Our protagonist, Lo, is lonely and unhappy with SOMETHING--she needs something. A red-headed person appears on her doorstep with a mission from the Delvers (an organization that Lo wanted to join but was rejected from as a baby)--there is an evil growing in the world and the Delvers believe Lo can help.  The red-head had a vision of seven robed figures around a tree, singing as the world burned. 

Lo, with the help of Su and Fi, begins researching the mission from centuries ago to try to uncover the cure. 

The bad force begins awakening in certain people, causing them to become selfish and stingy TO WHAT END? One of those people is Lo's lover, who eventually turns on her. 

Lo tracks them out to an abandoned military installation, where their device is being built to unleash the badness. WHAT IS THE BADNESS. 

Okay, so the Delvers control everyone with singing--a sort of sonic tuning that keeps them calm and unified. They have destroyed mass broadcasting and national media The bad guys are uncovering ancient radio towers 

Somehow Lo, Fi & five others make it to the sacred tree to complete the song.  I think a bad guy interrupts it and eventually birds turn to Lo and bow to her.  She has SOMEHOW destroyed both the bad guys and the Delvers.  A new world dawns. 

Delvers = collective, like ants or bees
Bad Guys = loners, like cats
Lo = the blend of both, individuality within the collective

## ONE SENTENCE VERSION:

#todo: Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your novel. Something like this: “A rogue physicist travels back in time to kill the apostle Paul.” (This is the summary for my first novel, Transgression.) The sentence will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This is the big picture, the analog of that big starting triangle in the snowflake picture.
