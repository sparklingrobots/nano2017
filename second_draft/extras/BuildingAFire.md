SUMMARY: The friends are in the woods building a fire together. There is no point to this scene yet. 

They sat in the darkening forest together. The sounds of crickets and frogs surrounded them, even though it's cliche, and the breeze tussled the leaves.  Below them the dry pine needles made a kind of carpet under their feet (WOW CLICHES HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A REAL FOREST TARA). 

Su was starting a fire, but it was getting dark. 
They sang a bit as they worked, their voices wandering the forest alongside each of them, in and out of hearing.  Fi sang a quiet song about fires, one Lo hadn't heard before. Fi sang about the tinder and the tree it came from, what the tinder was going to do for them.  What crazy kind of song is this?  It started with Lo who smiled as the words came pouring out as a solo: 

Why won't you light for us? 

Maybe we offended you. 

Maybe we're not in the right context. 

It's a weird song and not like the songs she's been learning about in her ancient music studies. 

She tries one of them out: 

C'mon, baby, light my fire

And the group howls with laughter.  This is not how you write songs. You don't write songs to the person, you write them to the world around that person.  But some of them have heard of these old songs, these love songs as they were called.  The long period of time when so many songs were about a man and a woman and the love between them. 

She has struggled to understand it for the past few weeks.  She listens to them and she gets it, sort of, the electricity that can pass between two people--mostly it's baffling how many and how long it went on.  

Most don't even seem to be about a person. 

Anyway the fire lights and they all keep singing now about the warmth and the dinner that is coming.  The song is improvised, really, though they sing together so much that it's hard to remember what it was to not know the song that the others are singing.  Which is why they keep laughing at her (me?) when I interject with my old time songs; it surprises them and we all laugh.

Tonight, though I've resolved not to, I will sleep alone, but what is alone when there are trees and animals and bugs around. What is alone when the whole world is still here with me.  

Perhaps I should resolve to forget the word alone.
