SUMMARY: Lo And Io's History. 


Lo and Io met in high school or whatever it is you do in this world when you are a teenager.  They met in high school and befcame deeply infatuated with each other.  They were both kind of strange and academic, and they hung out a lot and had ever since.  They liked to find songs together, though Io wasn't much of a singer.  They had fallen in and out of phsyical relationships through the years. 

At present they are not in a physical relationship--Lo is not in a physical relationship with anyone. She cuddles with Io and Su.  

Io loves Lo and always has and is very protective of her, but also somewhat unproductively judgmental. Io is always Lo's harbor in the storm.
