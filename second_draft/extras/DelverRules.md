Guidebook for how to run society, a text by and for Delver leadership. 

First, groups must remain tight knit and small.  

Second, the songs must be tightly controlled by the Delvers. No one will be allowed to create new songs. 

Third, mass media/mass broadcasting is dangerous and must not be rediscovered.

Fourth, the Delvers must be the only organizing principle. Communities are small and don't travel; Delvers however do travel and convene frequently.  They also have ways of broadcasting.
