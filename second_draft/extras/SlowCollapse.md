SUMMARY: How the world changed, the slow collapse. 

How much they felt like they got trapped in these shitty neighborhoods.  How they eventually realized that this is just their shitty life now.  How much it was like a hurricane but on a grand scale.   

That's when the change happened.

The cars went away gradually at first.  It happened more or less the "free market way" (a concept Lo struggled with in school).  Gas prices kept rising so people started driving less and less. Even the government stockpiles and subsidies weren't enough.  

It was way, way too slow for the polar bears though.  And the ice caps.  All told they estimated that global warming killed some 12,000,000 species.  It was also the end of free market capitalism and fossil fuels.  It was the end of Ferrari and American car culture, for better or worse.  

One of Lo's favorite laments was a threnody, really.  A threnody to the open road.  A threnody to the feeling of an engien shifting beneath you, to the pleasures of getting somewhere at top speed, whenever you wanted to.  Stopping by the side of the road and feeling the rush of the traffic along the freeway behind you.   To be truthful, she found this particular song a bit terrifying but it was also so keening and sad.  

In general she found the old times sad--she watched video clips of movies and the way people were pushed aside during a foot chase or cars were just thrown off a cliff with no regard for the occupants just because they weren't the star--it gave her a dark chill. 

But anyway, back to the history: 

People started driving less and less and then out of the blue there just wasn't any more gas, at least not in America. They had kept the secret very well.  One day the gas station owners were expecting a delivery and it just wouldn't come.  Depending on where you were in the supply chain you may have gotten an extra couple weeks but most of the small towns in the middle of America ran out first.  Nobody in the large cities paid much attention at first so they weren't any more prepared when their own end came.  In about three weeks it was over. 

Some large companies still had stockpiles for their fleets, so for a while business was stronger than ever. But realistically it was a short term solution and then it turned into a nationwide disaster. 

The effects they had been watching after hurricanes and earthquakes were suddenly nearby.  It was like they had been practicing for this. 

It wasn't terribly exciting, for the most part.  People died from pretty boring things: Old food they shouldn't have eaten.  A fall they didn't really recover from.  Not enough water.  The small towns were a mix of hard hit and just fine--depending on what they produced for the greater economy.  The American nation was a very large but tenuously connected road and without trucks to bring food and supplies, many of these small places disappeared.  Songs were written but most of those were known only to specialists.  You could find them inscribed in the sidewalks of these old places, or written inside of the old Walmarts--the ones in the Walmarts tended to be best preserved though it was hard to find them written along a wall or down the middle of an aisle. 

Certain neighborhoods and towns did better, but it was a bad time.  That's when it all really came to a head. 

It had been several hundred years but the scars of the old world hadn't healed completely.  The old roads were still in use.  Once the catastrophe part had stabilized, many neighborhoods had started decorating and building in their roads--leaving lanes for bicycles but filling in with trees, rose bushes, storage sheds, ponds.   

#todo: do people move? how? 

Of course many neighborhoods were abandoned.

The freeways were abandoned or converted as well.  They were so excruciating to walk along, all cement and straightlines, that nobody wanted to.  In some cities they were covered in graffiti and art but even those neighborhoods grew bored of them and moved away.  Some turned into parks.  Many of them became something like a river floating over head, dangerous but useful. 

#todo: Lo's frustration at not being a Delver? 

#todo: Can we write this again in just like, the explanation of her daily life instead of a flashback to another time? Or can we flashback to another time in a productive way? (like the story of the missionaries?)

_The way the lessons from the Great Mourning are immortalized in songs now, so she knows them. And maybe she's just part of a cult? Rather than this being teh same as everything._


The tipping point. The tipping point. The tipping point. 

They had given up on the tipping point eventually.  The human race, it seemed, was a crescent moon, a rocking chair.  It was a swing and it desired equilibrium and while it could swing wildly it was unlikely to come unmoored off the center bar.  Back and forth, generation upon generation.  Not a cycle just back and forth. 

Could it be a saw?  Could it cut through the basic substance of our lives? 

Or did they just need to move the swings somewhere else.  Put in a new center bar. 

So they started pushing on the foundations. 

There was the Great Mourning and one phase was, of course, rage. 

They had learned to channel their rage.  At first it was just emotional and then it actually became something greater. 

They could focus it and make things happen.  There was a literal energy that came from them and took down their enemies.  

A blast of rage could leave a mind washed clean and pale, a mouth drooling.  It was not permanent but it wasn't too different.  

It was dangerous. 

#todo: Can these be written like the book excerpts in Dune?
