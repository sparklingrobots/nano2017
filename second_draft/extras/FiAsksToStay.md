SUMMARY: Fi asks to stay. 

"Hey, Lo...I was wondering."

Lo nodded as she tied her shoes.  "What's up?"

"Do you...do you think I might be able to stay with you?"

Lo shrugged. She never minded an extra guest.  "Sure, we have space."

"Thanks, Lo.  I...I'd rather just stay nearby so we can work together."  The truth is the thought of returning to the Well turned her stomach.  The longer they were away the harder it became to return.  They had to be a different person there, attention focused almost entirely on becoming invisible.  If they couldn't be seen, they couldn't be hurt when no one noticed them, right? "I promise to be a good guest. I don't need much."

Lo figured that would be the case. Something about Fi seemed so generous and eager to please.
