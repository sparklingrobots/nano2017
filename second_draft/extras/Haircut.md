SUMMARY: Hair cut.

They decided it was time. 

They took a knife out of their pocket and started sharpening it.  Okay, Tara, but really: How primitive is this situation?  

The mirror was smudged because they were always leaning over to pop pimples and balancing their weight on their knuckles. But the view was clear.  

First the scissors.  Long heavy ropes (but a better word) fell to the floor. 

They left the top part a bit longer, but the sides were close cut.  (Do they have an electric razor? What is our relationship to electricity in the future?)

She used her knife to crop the sides. It was not easy. In fact, it looked like shit, choppy and uneven.  The top of the hair was floppy. 

She looked like a punk rocker. Maybe this would work.
