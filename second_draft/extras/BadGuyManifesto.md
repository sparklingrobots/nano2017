Let's Understand the Bad Guys.

*What are the subversive and dangerous ideas espoused by the bad guys? What is their manifesto?*

We are the Bad Guys, and if you don't find that funny, fuck you, we're laughing regardless. 

We believe that humans are a competitive and combative species, and that we are denying an important part of what it means to be human when we allow the Delvers to control our feelings. 

We believe that the Delvers are a bunch of manipulative fakers who pretend to have the interests of all humanity at heart but instead are merely seeking power and control. 

We are here to liberate humanity. We are here to help humanity feel the full range of their emotions: Not just the positive, pollyannaish utopian feelings, but also the feelings of rage and jealousy.  We believe it is important to acknowledge and honor the origins of our species and to finally express the fullness of our power. Keeping these feelings bottled in makes them even more dangerous and people need an outlet for their less positive feelings.

We are fatalistic, we are meant to die and be forgotten.
