The tipping point. The tipping point. The tipping point. 

They had given up on the tipping point eventually.  The human race, it seemed, was a crescent moon, a rocking chair.  It was a swing and it desired equilibrium and while it could swing wildly it was unlikely to come unmoored off the center bar.  Back and forth, generation upon generation.  Not a cycle just back and forth. 

Could it be a saw?  Could it cut through the basic substance of our lives? 

Or did they just need to move the swings somewhere else.  Put in a new center bar. 

So they started pushing on the foundations. 

There was the Great Mourning and one phase was, of course, rage. 

They had learned to channel their rage.  At first it was just emotional and then it actually became something greater. 

They could focus it and make things happen.  There was a literal energy that came from them and took down their enemies.  

A blast of rage could leave a mind washed clean and pale, a mouth drooling.  It was not permanent but it wasn't too different.  

It was dangerous. 

#todo: Can these be written like the book excerpts in Dune?
