SUMMARY: Singing the song. 

They pushed through the forest more quickly now--feeling more confident as a pair, plus the sunrise, weak as it was, started to give them a bit of light to work with...which meant the Bad Guys would be here soon, too. 



The tree was gone. 

The tree was gone.  They had cut down the tree!

How could they have cut down the tree?

[Who cut it down, and why?]


She spun in a circle.  There were dozens of trees around but they were young in comparison.  
The corpse of the big tree lay on the ground.  Some of the leaves were still green but it was dying.  It had fallen on the small low building nearby, crushing it under its weight. 

This had to be the tree the magic one had reported.  It looked like the pictures Lo had dug up.  

She ran to the tree and put her hands on the trunk.  A hot energy burned her hands and she whipped them away.  She felt tears and fear building up inside her. 

"It's not fair. It's not right. It wasn't even a good idea! It won't stop us! ANYONE could see that cutting this tree down was the wrong thing to do.  This was the oldest thing left on this earth after the Mourning.  And they know that! They know that!" She screamed at the carcass of the tree and felt her hands start to blister from the heat.  

"Lo."

Jy put their hand on her back.  

"Lo."

They said it again, quietly and she felt the fear draining out of her from the spot on her back where their warm hand rested. 

"Lo, we have to try it anyhow.  We can't bring the tree back."

She nodded. She wanted to sing for this lost tree right now, but she knew there were more urgent matters to attend to.  The Bad Guys were winning.  They were out there right now, having their meetings and planning ways to overthrow us all.  She wanted to tear them apart with her own hands, to use them to fertilize this tree.  And she felt sad for the fact that The Bad Guys were so lost. So hurt that they would do this to a beautiful and ancient tree.  She saw the world from their eyes for a short moment and felt her own emotions lock up.  No one would want to live in that world.  

She slumped to the ground.  She felt leaf litter under her blistered hands.  She felt the wind touching the tears she hadn't realized she let out.  She looked up and saw her people standing around, ready to help.  

"It is the only way. Change is coming." She spoke quietly and they felt briefly afraid of her. "This is the natural order of things; change sets in."

She nodded.  She could see the fear in their eyes but she could also see them setting their resolve, aligning with each other. Getting ready for battle. 

She stood up and brushed the leaves from her knees.  She wiped the tears from her face and reached out to Jy and Su.  

They walked around the stump of the tree, hands outstretched to one another.  The purple clouds overhead flickered with lightning and the wind picked up.  The storm was not natural.  It was the manifestation of the evil that had been living in this tree.  Lo didn't know if the tree had been cut down to stop the evil or if the death of the tree was meant to seal the evil in the world, to give it no escape.  But it didn't matter anyhow.  They would try.

Su started the song, somewhat to Lo's surprise. She had always been the quietest one. 

_Long fibers stretching tall_
_Let us see you grow. Let us see you rise._
_Flat paper leaves that move like blood_
_We let you see us grow. We let you see us rise._

Lo joined in with her, singing the counter words.  

_Together we are trembling_
_Together we are strong_
_Our eyes are wide_
_The perfume of your love, the perfume_

Jy added the third: 

_sacred water sacred water_
_we're holding on_
_flowers of your holy love_
_we're closer, we're closer_.

They kept singing the first verse looping together.  Their voices rang out together, but the song was noticeably incomplete. Lo looked at Nw and saw them standing there, staring up at the clouds, utterly paralyzed.  Lo knew instinctively she couldn't walk over to Nw right now.  She began clapping with their song, and Nw jumped. They looked over at Lo.  The fear that had set in ever since that night with Io surged in her chest.  Her voice wobbled but she kept on singing and clapping.  It didn't matter in Nw had turned. Lo needed to believe in her heart that they hadn't.  It was the only way. 

Nw seemed to turn away, slowly, or to be caught in the act of doing so: a body that wanted to go one way with eyes that were fixed on Lo disagreeing. They seemed hypnotized, controlled by something outside themselves.  

Lo took a chance and added a new line.  The song wasn't working yet anyhow, maybe it was okay to alter it. 

She took a deep breath and pitched her voice high, a wail over the other two: 

_C'mon, baby, light my fire_

She could feel Jy & Su both whipped their heads to look at her but they kept singing. She stared directly at Nw, pleading with every fiber of her body, returning to the original melody and words. There seemed to be a light growing from the stump of the tree.  

Nw had shifted their intense focus to the light.  They walked forward and almost touched it.  Lo wondered what was going on in there but couldn't move if she wanted to--her legs seemed to be stuck where they were. 

Finally she heard, in a great burst, Nw's voice joining them, rich and strong:

_Meet us under the old willow tree_
_We will be there to fight_
_When we fight we fold_
_Must us under the old willow tree_

Nothing seemed to be happening with the tree yet but Lo could feel tears flowing down her face.  Through everything they had managed to arrive here togther.
