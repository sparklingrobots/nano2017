The moment stretched out. Fi didn't respond in kind at first -- her face frozen in fear, she darted a look over her shoulder and ducked behind the building. 

Finally she stepped around the corner and looked directly at Lo. They watched each other for a long time, two animals in the dark, sizing each other up.  

If they'd gotten to Fi, odds of success were low anyhow.  With Io there had been no sign of the change, but Lo looked closely anyhow, searching for signs. Fi seemed nervous, watching Lo intently but shifting her weight back and forth on her feet. And Fi seemed scared, more ready to turn and run than to fight.  

And then Lo realized her fears didn't matter: Without Fi, Lo couldn't sing the song.  She needed all three voices and without any one of them, they were lost.  So, she responded with her own signature whistle and stood up a half foot. If Fi had turned, this was the opportunity to take a shot. 

Relief washed over Lo when she saw Fi's smile in response. 

Her legs swung through the brush as she ran, still crouching, to Fi's side.  

They hugged tightly, wet jackets between them. Fi whispered, "I didn't know if I'd make it through. I have so much to tell you."

Lo nodded and clapped her hands on Fi's shoulders. "I know. Let's find Su and get this done. Then we can talk as long as we want."  They turned back toward the south, toward the tree and their final attempt to set things right.  The clouds were turning from dark purple to a middle grey--the sun was coming up, somewhere beyond seeing.
