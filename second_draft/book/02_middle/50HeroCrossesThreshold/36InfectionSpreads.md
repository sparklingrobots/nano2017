Fi had been put in her quarters when she got back from the visit to the spring.  She had fallen off her bike--obviously not for the first time--as she rolled into the outer rings of the Delver gardens and a novice had found her there.  It had been such a shock to the novice that they started screaming, and by the time anyone else got there, the novice as passed out on the ground, too. 

Zo had, as always, taken control of the situation. She sent the novices back to tend the vegetable garden on the other side, knowing they would spend most of the time chattering amongst themselves about what had happened, and had used her delver summoning to bring some reliable mid-levels out.  No need to get Un and Mq involved just yet, though they'd know about it on some level the same way she had--a strong distress signal followed by silence. 

The four of them carried Fi and the novice to solitary rooms in the care ward. To Zo, they didn't seem to be suffering exactly the same thing--Fi seemed exhausted, worn out, and the novice seemed…almost electrified.  She left Fi to rest, told the nurse to alert her if she started to wake, and they started a course of hydration and honey. 

She went into the room with the novice.  She was a young girl, named Dai, if Zo remembered rightly. A bit uptight but mostly a good kid. She lay in bed, not conscious but moving, wriggling almost. The nurses buzzed in and out, checking her temperature, bringing water for her.  Zo watched as the head nurse came in and sat next to the girl. 

She put her hands on the girls wrists, flowing with her as she moved, and Zo saw the signs of a deep delving -- could almost feel it herself. The nurse's eyes fluttered in a way that seemed similar to the girl's own frantic movements.  The nurses' method of delving focused more on biology, usually, steadying heart beats or respiration rates, and then at more advanced levels, helping the blood know which cells to fight, relieving dangerous inflammation, helping move cholesterol to safe places, rewiring the way the kidney processed fluids to make fewer stones--all kinds of things. It was the closest thing to magic that Zo knew, and she loved watching them work. 

But this one wasn't going the way Zo expected. The girl wasn't calming any and the nurse (might need a name) had beads of sweat forming on her head.  The other nurses watched as they worked, eyes flicking over to the scene on the bed. The nurse had started humming a song Zo hadn't heard before, it was a...it didn't comfort Zo to hear it, if anything there was something deeply wrong about the song.  

A second nurse came up behind the first nurse, and placed her hands on the nurses' shoulder blades.  She braced herself against the floor, and closed her eyes.  For a few seconds they floated there, the head nurse's quiet humming threading through the room, no one moving--the ward held its breath. Zo had an image of a snake eating its own tail, of flowers falling from the sky, and then a bright vision of a tree aflame, surrounded by seven robed figures--and it was interrupted when the second nurse whipped her hands away from the head nurse's back with a yelp. 

The head nurse slumped, no longer humming, and fell from the chair. Other nurses moved to catch her and Zo was surprised to hear her own voice ringing out with authority: 

"Stop! Do not touch her!" 

The nurse hit the floor, totally unable to catch herself. The younger nurses stared at Zo, but hadn't moved. The second nurse, the one who yelped, held her hands over her eyes, moaning and mumbling to her. 

"Everyone out!" 

The nurses clearly wanted to stay, were almost unable to leave their eldest in this state, but Zo shouted it again and they shuffled out, leaving Zo alone with the girl on the bed, the unconscious head nurse and the newly injured nurse moaning against the wall. 

She looked at the nurse who seemed most able to function--"Go get Un. No one go in the other room, and let me know if she wakes." 

She closed the door behind them. The girl on the bed had calmed, somewhat, seemed like a child with a bad dream now more than a sick girl. She turned to the nurse: 

"What happened? Are you okay?" 

At first it seemed as if the nurse didn't hear her, but she could see the woman growing a touch calmer.  She left her hands over her eyes as she spoke, palms pressed into the cups of her eyes. 

"I...I am not okay. I don't think you should look in my eyes. I dont' know what just happened, but it feels like an infection, almost." The nurse was gradually resuming her professional detachment, reporting the details as she saw them. "The head nurse seemed to need support, so I did a supporting delve, intended only to give her more strength. I've done it for the other nurses, never for the head nurse. She's never needed it in my experience. Something about that song...something about it seemed off." 

Zo knew what she was talking about.  They had to guard against the wrong songs, and both of them had sharp intuition in these matters--all Delvers did. 

"When I first Delved her, I was just giving her more power...I thought it would help her stop or maybe even fix the song." The nurse dropped her head, rubbed her palms into her eyes, and then tilted her headback, eyes closed.   "But it just got stronger. So I fought her. I'm sorry, Zo, I know i should have trusted her, but...I fought her. And I saw...I saw terrible things, a vision of the tree at the spring on fire...and horrible songs. I can't see anything but the tree now, really, I think something is wrong with me." 

Un entered the room silently. Zo nodded at him. "We'll need to get you isolated from the others until we know what's happening. Can you get yourself to one of the isolation rooms?" The nurse nodded. "You know this...but don't let anyone touch you, delve you, look you in the eyes. I don't want this spreading." The nurse nodded meekly and began feeling her way toward the door, then made her way out. 

When the door closed, Zo looked at Un--the set of his face was stern, but she knew it masked a fear she felt herself. 

"Help me get her on her back--grab some gloves and shield yourself." They both pulled on a pair of thick rubber gloves and took a moment to breathe deeply and seal themselves from any outside stimulus.  

They turned the nurse over--Zo was relieved to know she was breathing--and laid a pillow under her head on the floor.  Un, to his credit, didn't ask any questions and let Zo lead. 

"Fi came back. She's...well, I don't know how she is. It's been a fast morning. This girl here found her, unconscious in the [specific section of the garden], she screamed--you probably felt that--and then I found the both of them unconscious. 

We brought them down here--Fi's in another room, resting--and she" Zo gestured at the head nurse "tried to delve her. Fi has been basically unconscious, but this girl became unstable quickly.  But...something went wrong.  The head nurse...she...I don't know, she started singing a song..." Zo could have hummed it, the melody was still stuck in her head. "The one who just left...she tried to help..." Zo didn't want to share about the vision She didn't know why. 

"Anyway, she was somehow...hurt by the head nurse. I think...whatever is wrong with Fi is spreading. We need to keep them isolated until we figure out what is happening." 

Un nodded. The level of calm he held at the moment unnerved her more than anything else; she felt rattled to her core. How would they solve this with the head nurse herself ill? He left the room without saying anything, and she could hear him speaking quietly with the other nurses, making arrangements for the head nurse to be moved into her own unit, making the precautions known.  

As she listened to his quiet voice, that authority she knew they both had, she felt a deep wave of uncertainty.  There were two Wells, she saw it all of a sudden very clearly.  There were two Wells, there always had been--they just lived in the same place. There was her Well, the place of goodness and togetherness, the place of healing and growth, and this other Well...a place of division, discord, power--and somehow the second Well was coming into focus.  There would be dissension and fear, there would be fighting--and she could tell, somehow, that Un would be at the Center of it all. 

Dark times had finally come to the Well, and Zo felt wildly unprepared.
