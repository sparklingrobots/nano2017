Fi felt like broken glass. She had a vague sense that a week or so had passed while she was in here, but not any clear sense of what was going on.

She lay still, eyes open.  When the nurse came in, she turned her head to face her and the nurse shrieked and spilled the water in her hand.  She rushed out of the room, Fi could almost feel her fear as she told the other nurses that Fi was awakw, was she okay was she okay she looked at her, would she be okay? Fi had no idea what to make of that. 

Another nurse came in and bent down to clean up the water, avoiding looking at Fi again, Fi reached up to her own face, wondering what had scared the nurse...everything seemed normal--a few scabs, it seemed, maybe those looked worse than they felt? The nurse left and Fi could hear murmurings in the hall.  She put her head back down and rolled away from the door. 

Several minutes later, the door reopened and whoever entered was clearly more prepared for whatever was wrong with Fi.  Their voice was restrained, calm, as they made small talk.  Fi didn't turn back to them and they didn't ask her to. 

"Porridge here by your bedside, if you're hungry."

Fi waited until the door closed and then rolled over, sat up with a good push and a cringe.  The porridge was hot, good. She loved porridge and they'd made it the way she liked it.  It was good to be home, sometimes. 

The memories came back as she rummaged backward in time.  She remembered being here in the hospital.  She remembered someone...someone visiting her at night, though not who or why. Maybe just one of the nurses, though her memories had them in something other than the nursing garb.  Which we still need to describe.  The nurses wore close-fitted outfits of green, mostly, with some blue. The infirmary was below ground and always a bit cool, so they tended to wear long sleeves and long pants.  They had a special robe and badge for when formal ceremonies were happening, but none of them wore that today.  The one who tended Fi wore a knit cap to hold her hair in. 

She sought for older memories, and there was a lot of blankness...she remembered with a shock the vision of the tree, the fluorescent energy flowing up and out of it. Falling out of the tree. And then the long ride home, just her and her bicycle. She stopped overnight, near a shelter she usually would have stayed in...but she didn't want to see anyone just yet.  She knew something dangerous was happening, she knew, somehow, that she might run into the wrong person out here.  She found a shallow overhang a few hundred yards away and collapsed there for the night.  

When she woke in the morning, she forced herself to drink some water and then began the last flight to the Well. She fell several times, her body unwilling to listen to her mind in the state it was in.  She felt compelled to get to the Well, to warn Un and the others, but there was another thread...she couldn't look directly at it, but there was a desire in her to destroy.  It was a feeling she'd never really known, even at her angriest, and it was only something physical that got her to the Well--habit, perhaps, or wisdom buried deep inside her. 

She couldn't remember getting to the hospital. She didn't know what, if anything, she had said.

She was still scraping the last bits of porridge when Zo came inside the room. Fi would have expected, perhaps, Un to visit or one of the gardeners. Zo....she barely knew Zo.  

Zo wore her glasses and trained her eyes on the floor--unsettling. Fi had never seen Zo or any of the Three with anything less than a regal posture.  She moved toward Fi and held her hand out.  Fi reached out and realized she was being handed a pair of lenses.  She took them and put them on, it was the obvious thing. 

Once they were on, she said, voice cracking, "Hello, Zo. Good day to you and all the Well."

Zo let her gaze drift upward until she could confirm that the glasses were on Fi's face out of her peripheral vision, then straightened her back and look directly at Fi.  Fi sat patiently, unsure why they were both lensed here in the Well together. 

The two of them wait a moment, Fi in her bed, red hair mussed from days in bed, Zo standing near the door, wearing something other than her formal robes. They both knew the forms--come together, hold hands briefly, attune to one another--but Fi as the lesser one, as the one in a hospital bed--she didn't feel comfortable with that.  And Zo stayed quite far. 

Fi realized that Zo was wearing gloves, anyhow. 

"Fi. So good to see you awake." The warmth in Zo's voice was very welcome, but Fi just nodded. 

"I'm sorry for....this. I'm sorry for this greeting.  We think...there have been some incidents since you came back and we are taking some precautions. I'm sure you understand they are necessary..."

"What incidents?" 

"We've...a few nurses have been injured by direct contact with you. Gloves seem to help, as long as they are thick and not leather.  We aren't sure about the eye contact, but some of the injured nurses have had issues with eye contact. So we're just playing it safe."

What I actually wanted this scene to be: Showing Fi fighting off the infection. Because she *was* infected by the tree--in addition to receiving the vision--which now that I think about it should be from the tree's perspective, and not a vision in the way that human eyeballs would see it. But something like Fi feels she is suddenly enormous, she has arms beyond counting, and fingers beyond that.  She cannot move, she feels herself grown deep into the ground, she is drinking from a spring at her feet.  She feels, in her side, an acute pain, a wound, it's bleeding but she can't reach down to touch it.  She realizes none of the birds are here, they have left, and she hears a new kind of song...seven voices calling up from the ground. The wind is strong, it blows the song around and up.  She can feel this song around her, weaving together, coming closer to her--wrapping itself up against her. It doesn't cure the wound, no--it doesn't cure it at all.  But it does stop the bleeding.  Whatever made the wound is still inside her, and she groans mightily.  The song grows louder in response, and then it finishes.  She can tell the source of the song are seven humans, seven of those robed people who harvest the bubbleweed on the good years, but she doesn't have the resolution needed to see faces. 

As Fi interprets the vision, she realizes that these are....this vision must be old.  The robes are not like we wear now, but a rough version of it.

Fi's memory of the last few days: 


Frequent flashes of that tree, of that damn, burning tree, those people singing that horrible song.  It came upon her often, leaving her stricken. The nurses seemed more worried about her now than before, when she was in a coma.  They were scared of her. 

And that was right. It was right for them to be scared of her.  She veered so quickly these days from being afraid of herself to knowing that they all had reason to fear her.  She found herself panting when it finally passed, physically exhausted and emotionally shaken.  

There was something very, very wrong with her.  She wished the nurses would fix her, she felt an old resentment rising inside her, that sense she'd always had of not being quite good enough for the Well, never meriting anyone's full attention or love.  It was a feeling that had mostly subsided over the years, that she had worked hard to heal in herself, but now it was fresh. Why wouldn't they fix her? Why wouldn't they love her? 
It was clear now as any time--this would be hers to fight off. When she was lucid she understood why the nurses stayed away. 
The time passed mostly in darkness. 
She curled up against the wall when it was bad, crying. Some small part of her watched as the majority of her crumbled under the pressure.  But that small part--that part felt true and unstoppable and uncrumble-able.  That small part began to be like a light, and she started nursing it, caring for it, like a person lost in the woods on a cold night. It seemed that if she could encourage that part, that it would grow and push out all this rage and darkness.
Through it all she believed in goodness, though the sickness tried hard to break her of the habit.

She was strong.  As the fungus pulsed inside her, finding old emotional wounds, flooding her with hormones and other neurochemicals, it felt doubt for the first time.  Well, not the first time, but it was rare.  The tree was incorruptible, it was used to living inside that strong beast, but here---here was a human. It worked well with humans, it was *made* to break humans. And yet, this human resisted. 

It could feel her, it could see her turning her attention away from it, away from the delicious visions it presented, images of revenge, of finally taking her place as the Queen's daughter--she turned away. She turned inward and watched...it looked like a small flame, sometimes, and other times, it was memories of sinking her hands into the soil.

It went on like this for a week. The fungus working to tempt her, Fi working to live in another part of her memory. 
When she woke, it went harder.  She refused to run, she refused to do anything outside the norm. She ate at the dining hall, though the others shunned her, and she was wracked with fever, shakes, exhaustion, every time they battled. 
Finally they clashed. It was in Un's study, naturally, Fi making tea.  A pair of scissors--the fungus knew what to do next, and sent her so many images of Un's body bleeding out on this gorgeous ancient rug.  She would feel free. Waves of nausea flooded her as she remembered all the times the didn't matter to Un, all the times he'd been dismissive and rude to her, and she didn't notice when the tea cup slid out of her hand to the floor because she was busy falling to the floor herself.  
The sound of the cup bouncing, the feel of warm tea splattering her legs, none of it mattered.  The fungus had found the sore spot, had found the lock and was turning the key. It would get in. It would.
But then...in Fi's mind, as her eyelids fluttered, the fungus encountered...the tree? How...? He saw from inside the tree, he saw the singing, the birds leaving, and then Fi started singing the song, quietly, almost a moaning more than singing. The fungus felt small. The fungus remembered the shape of the tree, knew it had encountered something it could not bend, and so the fungus went back to sleep in Fi.  
When she came back, Zo was bent over her, Un visible in the background, all faces turned towards her with glasses on. 
She pushed herself upright. She had...she had an idea what was going on here and she needed to solve this mystery.
