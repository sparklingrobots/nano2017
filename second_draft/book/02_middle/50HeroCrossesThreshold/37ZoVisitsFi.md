Over the next week, Fi stayed in a coma.  She didn't move much.  The nurses wore protective gloves when they checked on her, and Zo had given strict orders not to use any Delving on her.  

The head nurse had woken up the next day, but was utterly broken--she could hardly speak, and they had to keep the glasses on her all the time after an incident with another nurse making eye contact with her and fainting. The second nurse seemed to have recovered, but the head nurse was essentially staying in her quarters now.  

The young girl had finally recovered as well--seemed to be something like a fever that passed.  

So now it was a wait to see how it would turn out with Fi.  Zo had always had a distant relationship with Fi--they both spent a lot of time in the gardens, but Fi's closeness to Un had always put some space between her and Zo.  Zo had always felt a bit guilty about it...she was supposed to be the one who led everyone with love, she felt a special duty to the gardeners, and Fi herself had always seemed to be nothing other than sweetness incarnate.  But her association with Un....which Zo knew wasn't Fi's fault...it just sowed distrust in Zo.  

She visited her often, slipping into the isolation chamber late at night when the nurses were mostly asleep.   She eventually started talking to Fi, or just talking out loud, maybe.  There were so few people she could talk to in the Well, and these isolation chambers were protected from the general Delver connectivity, one of the only shelters in the whole world where Zo could let down her guards. 

Mostly she told Fi that she was sorry, at first, that this shouldn't have happened, they shouldn't have risked sending her to the Well. And complimented Fi for her bravery and toughness in getting back to the Well.  They had tended several scrapes on her knees, elbows, hands, face--she had obviously fallen off her bike several times on the trip back.  

And eventually she changed to another subject. She talked about Un, about his unfair hold on Fi, on his callousness, his neglect.  Sitting here, seeing FInelle's face covered in scabs, her breathing steady and shallow, occasional fits of struggle that Zo neither understood nor could ease...she felt a rage rising inside her that she had ever let Un control Fi so totally.  It was common in the Well to pick a favorite, to have a dedicated assistant once you got to their level, so she hadn't questioned it as she should have. She remembered seeing Un toy with the girl, inviting her up during important meetings just to order her to make tea. But other times, she could see an almost tender feeling in Un's eyes when he looked at Fi. 

One time, Zo remembered asking Un about it. "What's with you and her?" she asked, trying to sound casual as they browsed some reports from the outside villages.

Un, calm, of course he was calm, responded, "She's my assistant." and it had seemed so final and obvious that Zo didn't bring it up again. 

This journey to the tree had been one of the only respectful acts Un had ever given to Fi. The girl truly was gifted with plants, an unusual talent like Zo had never seen. Zo wasn't sure anyone in the history of the Well had ever been so naturally gifted--and best of all she was in love with plants, too.  It was talent married to passion.  Probably this was the only way the girl had managed her relationship with Un. Zo wondered sometimes what transpired between Fi and the plants, something rich enough to take the place of human interaction, it seemed. Or perhaps just something safer than human interaction. 

Tonight Fi was restless, she was moving a lot. Nurses came in more frequently to check on her. They didn't have many tools at their disposal, without the delving. One put a cool cloth on her head and turned it every few minutes--it seemed to help, but Zo liked the quiet.  "I'll do that." 

The nurse looked skeptical but a bit hopeful, out the corner of her eye. "You're sure?" Zo could tell she knew this could get her in trouble.

"No one will hear tell of it," Zo said with a gentle laugh. 

The nurse nodded and left the room quickly, and Zo pulled up the chair. 

This close, she could see the way FI's eyes were darting behind her lids.  She could see the little constellation of freckles on her eyelids, and the deep tan of her skin. 

"Fi, I want you to get through this. I want you to have your moment, I know your time is coming. I want you to leave Un's service, and I want you to thrive. Fi, you can survive this, you can. I want to know what you saw. I think you saw something important and I want to make sure the Well will be okay. So fight, Finelle.  Fight this." 

She turned the washcloth.  The urge to touch the girl was strong, it was such a default way of interacting and calming another person, but Zo resisted.
