Lo meets the queen for the first time. Falls in love and swears to herself she will defend the Delvers.

She meets the Queen and realizes the Queen is wonderful, magical, everything a Queen should be--and realizes also that she will have to kill her to move forward with the plan to save the Well.  (For tension reasons I think the Queen will need to be encountered earlier on, to give Lo hope that the Delvers are still good in the heart of them.
