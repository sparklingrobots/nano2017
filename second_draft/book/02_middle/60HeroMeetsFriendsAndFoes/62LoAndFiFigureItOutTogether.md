SUMMARY: Fi and Lo talk, Fi shares what she knows about the fungus, Lo shares what she knows about the song.  Together they work out the outcomes--if the fungus is cured, what happens? If the fungus is not cured, what happens? If the Bad Delvers are allowed to go on?  How can they disable/kill/whatever the bad people given how connected they are to all the good delvers? 



Fi knows what about the fungus: 

It's inside the willow. 

Is it causing people to go bad? If yes, how do they get infected? Why wasn't it infecting people before? 

Is there any connection between the strength of their bubbleweed harvest and the infection? Yes, at least becuase of the strengthening and protecting spells on the tree. 

Can it be killed? Yes.

If the fungus dies, does that affect the delvers long term?

To stop the violence, we need to

Cure/fix/kill delvers who are sick

Heal the tree or re seal the tree with a song

What is the violence? Who is working towards it?

The tree has a long-held secret: it is infected with a fungus we discovered was the cause of most of our suffering and division.  Long ago there was a battle to eradicate the fungus but a faction of people didn't agree with it.  After an outbreak in the area, they couldn't cure the tree so they cast some strong protection on it. 

That protection is weakened now.

It turns out the Delvers rely on a metabolized byproduct of the fungus for their powers. Some of them have known about this relationship for a long time and are defending the fungus to protect themselves. (Is it possible it was a proto delver who saved it in the first place?)

The good Delvers are oblivious to the situation until the spells weaken. Why can't the Delvers reseal the tree themselves? Why is Ok the one who needs to do it?

Because those who have the metabolized fungus are weak and damaged by the original. Lo doesn't have that initial fungus thing.

The deal is: she destroys the evil fungus in the tree. Does that mean they can't have the Delver skills? Or are we going to say they've relied on it but don't actually need it anymore?

Is this about destroying a technology? Getting rid of the good with the bad and rebuilding on your own strength.

What about the solution is bad for the good delvers? We need Lo to choose to risk the Delvers, but why?
