ANYWAY the way this all relates to the novel is I feel a compulsion to add in characters with mental illness, not to make it about mental illness, I probably won't even give them diagnoses. But just because it's real and it's not going anywhere. Or at least, if no one in my novels is ill, then there should probably be some kind of explanation for it. Maybe one of them (Lo?) goes to the Delvers for treatment of some illness. Lo feels (somehow) like she could be schizophrenic but I don't feel able (yet) to write that story (though part of me says, so? You're not able yet to write a novel, and yet here you are.).  

Okay, but....hmmm. Giving Lo a medical reliance on the Delvers DOES heighten the tension. Now she's not just destabilizing society, but also destabilizing herself. Having her have the illness is also a nice (seeming) way to give her oppportunities for the illness to contribute, and not simply detract.  It will do both, of course.

The easier/less scary option is, of course, to give someone *else* the illness, (preferably two someone elses), so it doesn't have to be handled so dang perfectly. 

One option is Lo is caring for someone who is sick, who needs the Delvers.

The long walk to the hall was no longer the tragedy it was when Lo was a child. She could barely recall the intense feelings of visibility, of something close to shame, and she knew that was the work of the Delver she was seeing--it had that familiar fog of a memory healed incompletely.
