SUMMARY: Delver leaders debate about bringing Lo into the mission. Lo's history is unveiled a bit. 

Zo walked down the long curving hallway, carrying the weight of the day's news in her shoulders. She had just come from seeing the queen, and felt cold. Probably just the plants and the sunlight, she told herself, though she felt unsettled in more than a physical way.  She had heard of trains, from the times before, had seen the tracks around. They always seemed terrifying, rickety, full of their own momentum as they flew along those tiny metal rods, unable to turn or stop or do anything at all.  That's how the Well felt, these days, locked in, hurtling forward, and she didn't know anymore who was in charge.  The queen had been dreamy, almost, lost in a haze Zo couldn't penetrate or even see. 

She knew the queen lived a different timeline from the rest of us, absorbed with different concerns, but it rattled her that the queen didn't seem worried about the missing Delvers, the lost border towns, the murder...though when Zo mentioned her plan, the queen had looked at her with a directness and clarity Zo had felt it like sun on her skin.  She looked at Zo, but her mind was elsewhere, weighing the plan, Zo assumed, or something like that.  She waited, quietly, feeling the heat of the Queen's eyes and breathing deliberately, feeling that humid air in her lungs, and the Queen had finally sat back, closed her eyes.  She was out of breath, but a slight smile landed on her face. 

"Yes, Lo. That will go well." 

Zo nodded, all business, trying to conceal her confusion that the Queen would know anything at all about this LoAna Iquy. She said her name with unexpected tenderness--Zo assumed Lo was a nickname? In any case, the Queen had fallen silent, closed her eyes, and Zo knew when her cue to leave had come. 

It all spun through her mind as she walked through the Well, heading for her meeting with Un and Mq.  Technically they were just three friends meeting, if anyone had asked, but the reality was they were the heart of the Delver council.  What happened here is what would happen at the Council meeting, what happened here was, inexplicably, what started the train going one way or another.  Zo still didn't understand it, not really--her skills lay elsewhere, more in the planning and execution than in the politics. Frankly these meetings filled her with dread--some dark forces at work under the surface. She didn't like things beyond her understanding. Fish pooling silently under the surface, shadows moving in unseeable patterns. 

When Zo entered the room, Mq and Un greeted her brightly after a pause so short it was almost imperceptible. Un got up, robe swishing as they walked to the tea pot and began making tea, filling the kettle with water, parceling the dried leaves into three unmatched diffusers.  Zo bowed and gave the expected greeting, which I should probably develop into something described, Un and Mq returned it with a brusqueness that bordered on dismissive--as usual keeping to the forms but not respect them, except in public.

The walls were lined with cloth, some woven here at the Well and some ancient, found in old buildings and hung up here. The Delver-made cloth was coarse compared to the old stuff--Zo had been working with the textiles people on that, trying to figure out the difference, was it in the weaving, the combing, the spinning?

She sat down across from where Un and Mq had been seated. She didn't like that they'd been here first, was unsettled by it in a way she couldn't quite put her finger on. Bird shadows flitting on the forest floor.  Fi entered the room, quietly shuffled over to the tea kettle so Un left and sat down.  Zo knew they would have to sort out what to do with Fi and the other damaged ones--they made the Delvers uncomfortable and that kind of tension would not be good for the community as a whole.  But they couldn't simply eject Fi, either.  Bad for morale. Zo had always liked Fi, had the sense that Fi hadn't quite gotten a fair shake in all this. 

Zo stopped watching Fi pouring the tea and looked back at Un. She cleared her throat, "You called us here to talk about the situation?"

Un nodded, wrapping his fingers around his knee, head angled to the side. His speaking voice sounded dry, almost, always had. "We need to call a Council meeting. We need a plan." 

He paused, clearly expecting some response, but Zo and Mq both sat quietly until he resumed. 

"I don't know what's happening, but we have a big knot of troubles and I, for one, think they are connected.  The tree is sick, and it's spreading to us.  We have our damaged Delvers," his round eyes flicked toward Fi and back. Zo glanced unintentionally at Fi and saw them cringe away from the attention. "There's something wrong with the tree, maybe with the harvest as a whole. We can't go another seven years on our supplies, just hoping the next harvest is good again. And third, we need to figure out if this has anything to do with..." he trailed off and gestured generally, taking in the whole room.  

"With the border towns?" Zo filled in. 

"Yes, obviously." His eyes unconsciously returned to Fi. He must not want to say anything in front of them. 

"Well, we can't send any more Delvers, not after the way the last one came back," Mq responded gruffly. 

"I have some ideas about the second one," Zo started. Zo's role as community organizer [need a better title] meant she knew a lot about the area and the people who lived there. "There's a woman named Lo who writes books about the area--she's knowledgeable and well connected. If anyone is going to know something special about that tree, she is where I'd start."

"She's not a Delver--she's just another person. I've only met her once or twice, but I reviewed her book on the area before she published it and found her quite insightful."

"What's her full name?" Mq asked. Mq's specialty as a delver was to test new born babies to see if they would be a good fit for the Delvers. It had been quite a while since Mq had done the tests themselves--now a gray-haired and rugged faced person, Mq was responsible for training and overseeing the corps of Finders. They pulled up their book of names. 

"Lo Ana Iquy."

Mq began flipping through the book, cross-referencing their enormous storage cavern's organizational scheme. "Fi, fetch me this file, if you would." Mq scrawled a ten digit number on a note card and passed it over. 

"In the mean time, I have reports of more Delvers going missing. We haven't lost any here but there seems to be a handful of Wells suffering from missing Delvers and....other disturbing incidents."

"You think it's related?"

#todo: New scenes from Delver Leadership perspective. 

"The timing is incredibly suspicious. I've sent envoys to each Well reporting missing Delvers to tell them what we experienced. I don't trust it by mail."

[stuff happens, or maybe the file is brought in with them]

Fi returned with the file, put it on the table and returned to their seat on the side of the room. 

Mq opened the file and started scanning. Un could see something interesting was presenting itself by the way Mq's eyes opened slightly.  

"I don't think she's a good choice." Mq said, still lost in the file. 

Un arched an eyebrow and waited.  

"She has...a strange history.  We tested her as a baby and I thought at first she would be perfect for us.  She's got a strong voice and memory for the songs, but there's something about her...we brought her here and although she was very well behaved, there was something...off.  The nursery was disrupted the entire time she was here. She had a lot of power for both unification and disruption but we couldn't get her to work for us. We had to send her home."

"They found her singing strange songs, even in the crib." A long pause.  "She liked to sing songs like the old songs, songs where she was the soloist, if you will." Un almost had forgotten the word. "The other babies would sing along with her but the nurses found it...discomfiting.  They felt like she was exerting a strange power over the other children."

"Is that all? It hardly seems enough to say no in this case."

"Another Delver had a vision about her.  They awoke from it in a fit, screaming 'Beware the King of All Birds'. And when they calmed down they described her perfectly-they said a person named Lo had risen to destroy the Delvers, that she would be the end of us." Mq paused at length.  "It was Gi who had the vision."

The three of them sat in silence.

"Let's send her." Though they weren't a hierarchical organization, Un spoke with the kind of authority only earned by long and hard service, smart ideas and a good eye for the Wells. The other two didn't respond at first, until Zo turned to Fi. 

"Get her for us."
