SUMMARY: Io is recruited by the Bad Guys without realizing it during a fictional search for a dog. 

Io didn't much like this Fi person hanging around.  Lo's attention was split and she was singing all the time. 

They were sitting at the kitchen table working on some chords for that stupid Delver project.  WHy should Lo help them when all they'd ever done was reject her? 

"I'm headed out." Their departure was so casual they weren't sure Lo noticed they were leaving until they heard her call goodbye when they were down the stairs and halfway out the door.  

They thought about going to the Delvers.  They could tell their emotions were a bit out of whack lately; they'd been feeling increasingly jealous of Lo and Fi.  And normally this is how they fix things, right? They go talk about it, they sing a song and they find a gift fo Lo and for Fi to help them normalize and warm up that relationship.  

But the Delvers had seemed like the wrong solution.  Io wondered if it was time to move on from Lo.  They didn't realize they were already halfway into town when they saw a person walking in the woods.  They said hello and the person--a very pale, sort of forgettable person--said hi back.  Io felt a desire to stop and say hello.  Just to feel some kind of human companionship. But before they could open their mouth to speak, the other person spoke. 

"Howdy, neighbor." The voice was low. Io began to suspect they were a man--it was so rare to see one.  

"Hi there."

"Don't suppose you've seen a small dog around?"

Truthfully Io hadn't been paying the least attention. "Sorry, I didn't notice anything.  Are you missing one?"

"Yeah, my beagle..."  Io felt a powerful wave of sympathy and wanted to help immediately. 

"Aw, a beagle? What's their name?"

"Meatball."

"Let's find Meatball."

When they stopped in front of Io's place several hours later, the pretense of the dog search had been erased from Io's memory entirely.  Their memory of the afternoon was a bit foggy, but they wanted to hang out with Os again. "Want to grab some tea tomorrow?"

"Sure, why don't you come to my place?"

[etc etc]

Lo looked a bit curious as Io came in but didn't ask.  They didn't need to share. [Need to establish a better relationshp sooner.]
