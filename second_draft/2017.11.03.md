They decided it was time. 

They took a knife out of their pocket and started sharpening it.  Okay, Tara, but really: How primitive is this situation?  

The mirror was smudged because they were always leaning over to pop pimples and balancing their weight on their knuckles. But the view was clear.  

First the scissors.  Long heavy ropes (but a better word) fell to the floor. 

They left the top part a bit longer, but the sides were close cut.  (Do they have an electric razor? What is our relationship to electricity in the future?)

She used her knife to crop the sides. It was not easy. In fact, it looked like shit, choppy and uneven.  The top of the hair was floppy. 

She looked like a punk rocker. Maybe this would work.

Lo felt the bark of the tree against her back as she woke up.  The day was clear and lovely.  She was glad for the tree and glad for the sky around her as well . She could hear the others cooking breakfast already. The smell of mushrooms cooking drew her closer to them. 

She wanted to admit something to them but couldn't quite put her finger on it. There was something bothering her. She felt guilty a lot but couldn't understnand why or what made her feel that way.
