I want to document my process for editing a novel, because I've never done it before and will likely forget the details over the MONTHS OR YEARS ~~OF SUFFERING~~ of work I'm undertaking. 

2017.11.01-2017.11.30
Writing the novel in one big intense go as part of NaNoWriMo.

2018.07.12
Re-read the novel at a writing retreat. Highlighted bits and tried to allocate to beginning/middle/end. 
Cut the draft into pieces, and created index cards for each "scene".

2018.11.01
Started trying to edit. Can't find my super helpful cut-up draft, but did find index cards. 

2018.11.02
Going through files and moving them into their proper location--though I got stuck on the first one which is barely a scene and more of a passing thought. Started rewriting it and need to find the narrative hook that will make this into something worth reading. 
Also need to sort out how I will name my chunks of text, and if I need to/want to retain the index cards. Either in their own format or maybe on github as cards there. Hmmm.
Ooh! I just dug up the paper copy that got all taped together back in July. Let's see if this still makes any sense to me....
Decided I would use #todo to mark things that need work directly in the text so I can just grep for them later.
