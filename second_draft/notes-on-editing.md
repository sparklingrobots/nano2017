I want to document my process for editing a novel, because I've never done it before and will likely forget the details over the MONTHS OR YEARS ~~OF SUFFERING~~ of work I'm undertaking. 

2017.11.01-2017.11.30
Writing the novel in one big intense go as part of NaNoWriMo.

Re-read the novel at a writing retreat. Highlighted bits and tried to allocate to beginning/middle/end. 
Cut the draft into pieces, and created index cards for each "scene".

Started trying to edit. Can't find my super helpful cut-up draft, but did find index cards.

Going through files and moving them into their proper location--though I got stuck on the first one which is barely a scene and more of a passing thought. Started rewriting it and need to find the narrative hook that will make this into something worth reading. 
Also need to sort out how I will name my chunks of text, and if I need to/want to retain the index cards. Either in their own format or maybe on github as cards there. Hmmm.
Ooh! I just dug up the paper copy that got all taped together back in July. Let's see if this still makes any sense to me....
Decided I would use #todo to mark things that need work directly in the text so I can just grep for them later.

I'm starting to feel where there needs to be more writing -- things need to be contextualized. Like maybe I can start to see how one begins to shape a chapter--but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I wrote some new stuff--feeling all filled up by this beautiful fall atmosphere I've missed so many years here. Also just feeling weird about this project and self-conscious and...I don't know. 
Sorting through my mind for something to do: I first turn to Revising Prose but am stymied by an example he claims is simple. I then google "How to outline", feeling that things might go easier if I had an outline of *some sort* instead of *no sort*.  I find an interesting "snowflake method" that feels related to what I am doing--sketching out the barest outlines and then filling it into something more like a novel. (Admittedly he says to do that part first and THEN write the novel.). I've now written several single sentences a la NYT Bestsellers List and they're all too long and also kind of bad. Partially the book is just tough to summarize. Reading a review of the Witch Elm makes me feel...I dunno, jealous? They all seem so great...straightforward 8 word summary, massively awesome book. I CAN DO THIS BUT IT *IS* HARD.
I started working on some of the Great Mourning stuff, thinking I can reshape it into a history written by the Delvers, which I love...we start with trusting that but then change to seeing it in a bad light as Lo does.  I just really need to sort out the shape of this story, to stop just sketching the situations and shying away from the details.  But, we'll get there. Fractal snowflakes.

Got a later start than I wanted this morning, but really enjoying the process so far. Last night Paul suggested I just write out the plot as I know it, which I did today and it is starting to feel manageable. Probably great swaths of things will be removed. I need to figure out what exactly make the Delvers bad and what exactly motivates the Bad Guys. I think I have an interesting story and I don't think that masculinity can be the only evil.
