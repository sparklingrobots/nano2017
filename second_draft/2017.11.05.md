The next day she tried to visit the tree and found the fence locked. 


Write about how they locked it up and kept it locked up--this is the forest they are hiding from her.

_Su riding a motorcycle to get to the library. She takes the freeway because it's less obvious. She loves riding. Describe the beautiful day she experiences.  She sees a car ahead and gets spooked. Only the gov't uses cars now and only for ceremonial purposes.  She tails them, watches them park it under a tree and start walking away. TOwards the library._

Su started the bike.  Technically they all shared the small tough dirt bike but everybody knew the bike was Su's. When someone took as much joy from something as su did from the bike, who else can really make a claim?  She spent hours fixing it, making new fuel, and dreaming of those days she would get to ride it.  

Since gasoline had gone away, they'd invented new fuel sources--fermented leaf litter, algae, corn syrup--most of which could be made on a local level with at least some degree of success.  So you'd still see vehicles on the road, though mostly smaller ones--smartcars or motorcycles, mopeds.  Some of the governments had shipping lanes up in the north, but they were mostly wind and sun driven and hard to replicate on a smaller scale. 

She pulled out of the alley and headed west.  She pulled onto the freeway, wary of obstacles and potholes as usual.  

She couldn't go as fast but she loved the freeway--the tall walls with their privacy, the long straight lines, no traffic.  It was worth the wilderness that had grown up in the cracks of the pavement. 

One time she'd gone out East and some of their freeways had been turned into parks, and while she had to admit they were perfectly nice, she had to admit they made her feel a little sad.  Lo had told her about the start of the freeways and she was relieved not to have to ride on them--the speeds sounded exhilarating but the crowds sounded unbearable.  She couldn't really imagine the freeways full of cars crawling along at low speed.  The past seemed a strange nightmare when Lo talked about it but they msut have liked what they had given how sad all the songs were. 

She realized she'd gotten distracted and while she was navigating a deer trail through the bushes just fine she hadn't noticed the Jeep up ahead.  They were driving a bit faster than her.  She had no idea if they knew she was back here--they were louder than her engine.  She kept following--it was almost unheard of to find a vehicle of that size still in operation.  It was almost mythical--a vehicle for the ultrarich or the ultradangerous.  It was certainly interesting enough to follow for a bit.  Her mission wasn't urgent. 

So she tailed them on this perfect late autumn day.  The sun flickered through the leaves on the trees as she pushed faster than she liked on the freeway.  A rabbit nearby darted off as she approached.  The sun warmed the back of her hands and the smell of leaves was rich in her nose--the trees were still fairly young on the 405 so the pines hadn't moved in yet. 

They didn't change their speed so she suspected they didn't see her.  She was feeling a bit smug about it--she liked to keep the bike matte, to wear a lot of brown and green--Bu would have stood out in her purples.  

The jeep swerved off the freeway.  She was starting to get whiffs of the fuel they were burning--it smelled like algae.  Expensive.
