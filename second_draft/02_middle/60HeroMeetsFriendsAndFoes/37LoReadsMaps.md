SUMMARY: Lo figures out a little bit more of the mystery by looking at old maps. 

She didn't remember the voice in her midn for at least a few days. (From the Council meeting).

They were all out, working.  The house was quiet, no devices humming, no sound of lights burning. All the lights were off so she sat in the kitchen near the largest window.  The large wooden table was from her childhood, her parent had collected the wood themselves from fallen timber and sickly trees.  That's how all furniture worked, which is also why people tended not to have large families. 

The wood didn't match, making stripes of darker and lighter woods.  The softer woods bore the marks of her childhood drawings, pens and crayons pressing light shapes into the wood.  

She had the papers out on the table.  A stack of books off to her left, neatly lined up on the edge of the table. In front of her the map stretched to nearly the ends of the table, and the folder of data was off to the right. 

She was beginning to think this was the wrong map.  The right place, but the wrong map.  Maybe the wrong scale, or maybe she needed a different *type* of map. 

Maybe it was a map from the wrong *time*.  

She moved over to the bookshelf and pulled off her oldest map book.  She wouldn't have computer time until Monday but for now this would do.  She pulled it out.  There was, indeed, a map of her forest--but so large that the forest itself wasn't even marked. The copyright said the book was published in 2047 but she knew that this map could have been much older, just copied and copied and copied forward in time. 

If she could just *get in* to the forest, this might all be for naught.  But ever since the fence had sprung up with the menacing signs on it, that had seemed like a poor idea.  She just needed to know what was growing there, to see if anything had *changed*. 

The next day she tried to visit the tree and found the fence locked. 

Write about how they locked it up and kept it locked up--this is the forest they are hiding from her.
