SUMMARY: Fi spills the beans about Lo's Delver past.

Fi arrived the next morning, knocking on their door around 9 am. Lo had not been expecting Fi (yes she had been). 

Fi offered to cook breakfast that first morning and it became something of a habit--they cooked breakfast, eggs and vegetables and mushrooms.  This particular day they'd gone out to the forest and found a giant puffball, which they'd cooked in big crescent moon wedges.  Lo admired the plate, the big wedge of mushroom with two eyes made of eggs.  Fi was growing on her. 

"How'd you sleep, Fi?"

"Just fine. I had a dream..."

Lo listened without looking up. She'd learned that Fi was a bit skittish about their sensitivities and abilities, and wasn't used to talking about them outside of the Well.  

"It was from when you were a baby."

Lo studiously contained her face. "What do you mean?"

"I mean it's from when you were with the Delvers."

Lo put her fork down, the tines resting on the unbroken yolk of one of the eggs.  "What do you mean?" she repeated. 

Fi looked up, eyes hidden behind her glasses. "You really don't know."

Lo waited as patiently as she could, feeling emotions rising inside her, feeling as if she were being brought to a boil.  Fi put her hand on Lo's arm, and Lo could feel the pressure draining off somewhat. 

"Tell me what you mean when I was with the Delvers."

"I, I assumed your parents would have told you about it..."

Lo just waited, her face calm as a pond. 

"I shouldn't tell you."

"I should think you won't be able to avoid it, now."

"I...Okay, look, you can't tell them you know. The Delvers or your parents. Nobody.

"When you were a baby the Delvers took you in."

The rage inside her finally blossomed into a bright red spot in her eyes. She'd known from the moment Fi had resisted telling her, she'd known the rage would come and she'd waited.  Almost smirking and now that it came she felt she could break every stick of furniture in the house.  She could throw her teacup at the wall and she could nearly feel every scrap of rage and sorrow she'd ever felt at not being chosen rising in her, it felt like it was physically moving up from her pelvis, up her spine and she could feel a bunch of sharp-edged rubies moving in her blood and she was ready for battle. 

Fi sat motionless, a rabbit caught in the panther's line of sight. No part of them blinked, twitched. Lo believed that Fi may have stopped breathing. 

She laughed.  She put down her teacup.  She walked out the front door.

She went to the spring, alone, for the first time since this had all started.  The tree was there, with a welling of sap on its bark that looked new--looked like blood.  She walked up to it, arms numb, hands numb, head floating.  She peered at the smear on the tree, the dripping color, and determined it was likely sap. 

She had known, of course.

She had known exactly where she belonged, from the start, from her earliest memories.  She wanted to storm into her parents' home and get the answers she wanted to know everything she wanted to reverse it all and suddenly her hand was very sore because she had started hitting the tree. 

She stopped. She sat beneath it, looking into the water. 

She almost didn't realize where she was or why she had come here.  But then it dawned: The Delvers couldn't follow her here.  And maybe here she could if there was something about her that was or wasn't like them.  

Goddam her hand hurt. 

There were a few birds nearby, singing their short melodies to each other.  The grass from the meadow rustled, dry and tall this late in the year. The smell of mud was strong. 

The tears were hot on her face.  She was crying as hard as she'd ever cried and was relieved to be alone, here, in this fucked up place the Delvers had sent her to. The Delvers who finally decided she was worth their time, now that it threatened them.  What the fuck was wrong with her that they didn't want her? What the fuck happened when she was there? How had her parents hidden this from her after her incessant and demanding interest in the Delvers? She wiped the tears from her face, which set off a new round and she sunk her head into her palms.
