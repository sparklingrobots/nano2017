SUMMARY: Su takes her motorcycle to another town -- breaking the Delvers' rules against travel.  
_Su riding a motorcycle to get to the library. She takes the freeway because it's less obvious. She loves riding. Describe the beautiful day she experiences.  She sees a car ahead and gets spooked. Only the gov't uses cars now and only for ceremonial purposes.  She tails them, watches them park it under a tree and start walking away. TOwards the library._

Su started the bike.  Technically they all shared the small tough dirt bike but everybody knew the bike was Su's. When someone took as much joy from something as su did from the bike, who else can really make a claim?  She spent hours fixing it, making new fuel, and dreaming of those days she would get to ride it.  

Since gasoline had gone away, they'd invented new fuel sources--fermented leaf litter, algae, corn syrup--most of which could be made on a local level with at least some degree of success.  So you'd still see vehicles on the road, though mostly smaller ones--smartcars or motorcycles, mopeds.  Some of the governments had shipping lanes up in the north, but they were mostly wind and sun driven and hard to replicate on a smaller scale. 

She pulled out of the alley and headed west.  She pulled onto the freeway, wary of obstacles and potholes as usual.  

She couldn't go as fast but she loved the freeway--the tall walls with their privacy, the long straight lines, no traffic.  It was worth the wilderness that had grown up in the cracks of the pavement. 

One time she'd gone out East and some of their freeways had been turned into parks, and while she had to admit they were perfectly nice, she had to admit they made her feel a little sad.  Lo had told her about the start of the freeways and she was relieved not to have to ride on them--the speeds sounded exhilarating but the crowds sounded unbearable.  She couldn't really imagine the freeways full of cars crawling along at low speed.  The past seemed a strange nightmare when Lo talked about it but they msut have liked what they had given how sad all the songs were. 

She realized she'd gotten distracted and while she was navigating a deer trail through the bushes just fine she hadn't noticed the Jeep up ahead.  They were driving a bit faster than her.  She had no idea if they knew she was back here--they were louder than her engine.  She kept following--it was almost unheard of to find a vehicle of that size still in operation.  It was almost mythical--a vehicle for the ultrarich or the ultradangerous.  It was certainly interesting enough to follow for a bit.  Her mission wasn't urgent. 

So she tailed them on this perfect late autumn day.  The sun flickered through the leaves on the trees as she pushed faster than she liked on the freeway.  A rabbit nearby darted off as she approached.  The sun warmed the back of her hands and the smell of leaves was rich in her nose--the trees were still fairly young on the 405 so the pines hadn't moved in yet. 

They didn't change their speed so she suspected they didn't see her.  She was feeling a bit smug about it--she liked to keep the bike matte, to wear a lot of brown and green--Bu would have stood out in her purples.  

The jeep swerved off the freeway.  She was starting to get whiffs of the fuel they were burning--it smelled like algae.  Expensive. 

_What happened to neighborhoods when the cars went away. Everything was far apart, how much work it took to get everything.  they had to mourn the fact that they coudlnt' go to Ikea in Burbank anymore, with an aside about how this was before IKEA became what it is now (mystery!)_

#todo: Su needs a more relevant errand to run. She is going to another town which is forbidden, to find out what is happening there.

Su knew she was supposed to go to the library for that book Lo needed.  But she also knew something was not right about this strange trio who had parked their car on the freeway to hide it and were now strolling nonchalantly down the street together.  She parked her bike in an alleyway and started walking after them. 

Two of them were smaller, the third taller.  Maybe six feet tall.  They might not have seemed suspicious but seeing them in a car was enough to get Su's attention regardless.  The one on the left wore a long dress, a soft jersey knit type thing that fell to the tops of her shoes, and a blue sweater over the top.  The one in the middle wore jeans and a t-shirt, a striped shirt, and a wool hat.  The one on teh right, the tall one, wore some kind of coverall.  They looked like they were dressed for different kinds of weather, even.  She followed along at a distance, then decided to go around the block and see if she could get a good look at their faces by passing directly next to them.  

She picked up her pace and jogged quickly to the right, then down an alley and took a quick left, only to nearly run into them. 

"What the fuck" snarled the one in the hat. 

"Whoa, sorry, didn't know you were there."

"Watch where you're fucking going, [slur] [not sold on this]"

The word was so old Su almost didn't recognize it.  The person who said it seemed shocked it had come out of her mouth but -- almost pleasantly so.  Like she didn't realize she could be so terrible. 

"This is Bad Guys turf, twinkie. I wouldn't hang around here no more." 

Su blinked in shock. 

[Something I hate about the universe I'm building.  It's so utopia-ish that it's hard to generate conflict...other than a "hey this ain't your utopia no more" pollyanna-ish vibe.  Feel like I'm trying to sprint before I crawl.]

She backed into the alley and discovered the tall one behind her and felt a sharp point pressing through her jacket into her flesh.  She started to shake and stepped forward, away from that blade. "We know you've been following us. And we want you to know that there's nothing here for you but trouble." Their voice was quiet and nearly familiar--maybe an accent Su is familiar with.  Su nodded. 

"Now say it out loud with me:" They paused. "I solemnly swear to leave this alone."

"I solemnly swear to leave this alone."

"I solemnly swear that I won't come back." 

Su repeated everything they said though most of it got lost in the fear of the moment.  The idea of threatening somebody's life was so foreign but somehow her body knew what to do and kept her safe. 

She sprinted back to the bike, her library errand entirely forgotten. 

Su was weeping when she walked in the door. Lo stood up, startled--it wasn't common to see people cry outside of the Circles. Lo walked toward her and wrapped her arms around her, feeling Su shake and tremble as she wept.  They stood there together without speaking for another five minutes.  

Finally Su felt whole enough to begin speaking and started telling Su everything: about the car, the threesome, about the knife. 

She kept apologizing about the library but Lo wouldn't hear it.  They sat on the couch together, arms entangled, as Su recovered.  The sun outside was beginning to set in that golden yellow color.  It was time to go back to the drawing board.
