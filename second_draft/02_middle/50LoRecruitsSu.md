SUMMARY: Lo recruits Su to the cause.

Su was reading a book when Lo returned home from the Well.  In truth, she's been trying and failing to read a book--Lo was supposed to be home today and she wasn't anywhere to be seen.  

So when the door opened, Su pretended to keep reading but her face broke into a smile.  

"I'm home."

Su threw the book down and hopped up. 

"You can't do that again."

They stood and looked at each other for a while.  Lo knew that Su hated this kind of thing but..she hadn't had a lot of choice. Then Lo dropped her bag and hugged Su, singing a quiet, regretful but not quite apologetic song in her ear.

"They needed me."

"What's happening?"

It was a long story and Su didn't entirely follow it.  But the basics: They needed to learn everything they could about the tree and its history and share it with the Delvers.  They needed to understand what lived inside of it and they needed to understand if it was as bad as the Delvers thought.  

They sat down to make a plan.  Over many cups of tea, and many breaks to hum songs together as they stretched their bodies, they put together a plan.  Su would go to the Library to get the books and maps Lo needed.  Lo would look at her existing research materials.  And then, once they knew a bit more, they would go to the tree itself.  They weren't Delvers--they should be safe. At least as far as anybody knew. 

[That's where the scene of Su going off on her motorcycle occurs.]
