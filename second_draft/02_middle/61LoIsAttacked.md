SUMMARY: Lo is attacked while singing at the tree.

The wind carried dust in it as she climbed over the fallen tree, heading deep into the forest surrounding the Well. She was tired of being cooped up, listening to the song only over headphones because of an angry librarian. Besides, she needed to hear the sounds of the forest as she sang, to know what animals would be around.  The spring itself was too far--they'd notice if she was gone for that long--but the forest here was very similar.  

She walked for an hour, at least, legs striding across the forest floor, hands brushing against trunks or holding branches away from her face.  Birds sang around her (NAME THEM) and once she saw a deer before it bolted.  She didn't want to be locked out of the Well, so it probably was time to stop.  She knelt below a tree, a big willow like the old tree, but no where near as big. She sunk her fingers into the mud, pushing through toughened dried leaves, and bent her head. 

She had to admit she was lost.  She thought she had found the song, but something seemed...not quite right about it.  She wasn't going to risk it with Fi yet--it wasn't safe. 

Quietly, the sound rising up from her chest and into her throat, a warm and low sound, she started to sing what she did know: 

Together we grow
We heal together
Together we gather
We love together

She imagined the other parts, overlapping--you could hardly make out any word but a staggered chorus of the word "Together". 

And cut short. Her ear had been filled with a piercing pain when she reached the last line--she couldn't tell if it was a bad noise or something else, but her ear was hurting.  

She waited, rocking back and forth on her knees with a hand over her ear. She decided to try again: 

Together we grow
We heal--

Again the pain.  Sooner than last time.  It didn't feel mechanical, it felt almsot--intelligent.  It felt sensitive to what she was doing and why.  She shook her head and drank some water as she waited for the pain to pass. 

After the pain subsided she tried a different song altogether, one she had learned from the archives: 

It's been a long, long time comin', 
But a change's gonna come, yes it is.

The pain didn't appear.  She kept singing. 

[insert two more lines]

It was a song she'd never heard the original performance of, but she had transcriptions of it.  It was a song she loved--she loved the idea that no matter what had happened, change was coming [ed note: is that waht the song is about?] It made her feel better. Whatever was happening now to the Delvers would change, whether or not she succeeded.  Whatever was happening to Lo and Fi and this tree would change.  She felt her inner equilibrium balance out.  

As soon as she tried the original song the pain in her ear was very sharp--she reached for her ear and wondered if she would feel blood.  But after a few seconds of silence, she was fine. 

This was not what she expected.  She hadn't truly expected the song to work with just her voice, but she hadn't expected a negative reaction? Was it the song itself? Was someone fucking with her? 

She stood up, a bit woozy from the pain.  She placed her hands against the bark of the tree, feeling that old papery surface and wishing, as always, that she could know what the tree knows.  She listened to the rustle of the leaves, dried but not yet fallen.

The she heard something a bit different. It sounded like a footstep.  It sounded like a human footstep, with the soft rustle of a windbreaker. 

She whipped her head around and saw a pale person turn and start sprinting away. They were carrying something in their right hand--a small box with some kind of stick or antenna out the top. 

She'd seen this person in the market before.  There was no reason for them to rush off--unless they were somehow responsible for her pain.  

She knew with a sinking feeling they must be.
