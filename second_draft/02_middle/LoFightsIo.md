Summary: A fight breaks out between Lo & Io. 

Okay, we need a fight or revelation between Lo and Io.  I don't know how to get there but if there's anything I know, it's that stability is an illusion.  Change is everpresent. Even when there is equilibrium it is ever shifting, and a push too far can take everything from great to disaster.  So let's do this. 


Io had been spending more time out of the house, but Lo had only recently started to notice.  She was so busy with the problem with the Delvers, and Io was so self-sufficient and independent that it hadn't seemed to be a problem.  

What Lo doesn't know is that Io has been hanging out with the Pale Man, who has been both vocally expressing some subversive and dangerous ideas and also emotionally manipulating Io with his Delver skills.
