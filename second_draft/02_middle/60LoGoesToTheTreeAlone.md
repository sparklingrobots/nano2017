SUMMARY: Lo goes to the facility/tree alone.

Su hadn't come back and Lo needed to get to the tree before the next full moon--she wass sure there would be a relevant before and after, that something would change.  The old legends she had found in her research indicated that the tree turned dark on full moons, that strange vapors and noises were witnessed then, and that the tree was friendly on the new moons.  

The full moon was a few days away. Lo needed to go now to see how it changed.  It was time for her to move.

After about an hour on the bike, she knew she was getting close.  It had been a few years since she'd been here but it had been such a big part of her research she didn't need to look at a map. 

But the fence was new. 

Was it?  It looked new.  But who would have a fence like this anymore?  Wire wrapped together in a grid, with sharp razor wire at the top.
