Summary: Fi finds out that Lo is going to do something bad to the Delvers and decides to stick with her.


She was there, as she had been every day this summer, bent over her spot in the library.  Fi smiled. A creature of habit, Lo...The library was deserted, she could have moved any time she wanted, spread out on several tables, but every day the same. Same chair, same table, same piles on the table.  Sometimes she had books out, sometimes, maps, mostly though she was bent over headphones on, tapping her fingers on the table with the song in her mind, head nodding along.  
She came up quietly behind her, not wanting to break concentration, and sat in the chair next to her, blocking Lo's sightlines to the Librarian. Lo looked up, and Fi was startled to see pain in her eyes. The pain disappeared quickly, Lo's shields up, and she smiled at Fi. 


The pain she had seen in Lo's face had seemed...deep. Troublesome. Had seemed like maybe the end of things.  Was Lo mad at Fi? Was she planning to leave? Fi thought it over some more.  Walked through her memories, Lo before Fi had gotten there, and then the emotions on her face. Fi had grown reliant on being able to Delve, but she wasn't an idiot--she didn't think Lo was angry with her. 
There was something else.  Guilt. It was guilt.
[Fi eventually figures out that Lo feels bad about betraying the Delvers and has to make her decision, but this is boring the fuck out of me.]
