SUMMARY: Lo becomes King of All Birds. The birds are the mentors that convince her to go.

A few hours later she was asleep beneath the tree. Her head ached but she was exhausted--unable to summon the wash of rage from earlier.  She was defeated. She had been defeated. She had been rejected and now here she was, errand boy for the victors.  

She looked up at the tree and saw another opening beginning to drip sap.  And she realized there was something new happening. 

There were birds.  There were birds in the branches, birds on the ground, birds in the nearby tree.  There was a bird on the small rock next to the sprint.  Sparrows, swallows, crows, even a hummingbird, a flycatcher, and a few geese.  They were silent.  They were watching her.  

She looked behind herself and realized they had surrounded her entirely.  She scrambled to get her back against the trunk of the tree.  

They sang together, all at once. Not the same song, but a song: A chaotic trumpeting, a mass of chirps and trills and honks all at once. She stood up, bracing herself against the tree.  

A crow flew down from the tree and landed in front of her.  It cawed, a single plaintive squawk and then it pitched forward, opening its wings wide to her, head down to the ground.  She didn't move. 

The other birds lined up near the crow, behind the crow, and started adopting the same posture.  

They were bowing to her. 

She felt compelled to return the gesture and executed something like she'd seen in old movies--a courtly bow, leg extended to the front.  She felt as much as she heard the birds start to depart while she was down, and by the time she straightened the last few birds were lifting off and flying away. 

This was not what she had expected.

When she got back to the apartment Fi was waiting.  They sat on the couch, drawing pictures of plants--an aloe vera, an exotic looking plant covered in spines and round bulbs.  Fi looked up and dropped the pencil. 

"Lo I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told you."

"You needed to tell me. I needed to know. I'm becoming who I am, I can feel that, and nobody knows quite what that means."

Fi didn't respond to that. 

"Fi I need to know what happened."

"I don't know the details, it was before my time obviously.  All I know is they took you in from your parents and there were...troubles.  There were troubles with the other babies.  The nursery couldn't control you by delving, so they sent you home.  I don't think they've ever done that before."

"That's it. They just sent my home."

"I don't know; you can tell as well as I can that I'm not very important to them. I assumed your parents had told you. Mq is scared of you; Un seems...Un seems intrigued."

"They never said anything. It was literally the only thing I ever wanted, to be part of the Delvers. It was..." Lo stopped. She was tired of reliving this loss after the day she'd had and the ... the thing with the birds. 

"So what was this dream of yours?"

"You were at the Well.  You were singing--not like a baby sings, more like a talented child. And a bird...a bird came out of your mouth. A crow.  It hovered above you as you sang, and then it flew away. And...the Delver nurses came in and called you King of All Birds."

"King of All Birds? What is that?"

"It's probably nothing; I've never heard it before. Just some weird dream shit."

Lo's face sagged. This was going to be harder than she ever anticipated. But it wasn't time to tell Fi what had just happened at the spring.
