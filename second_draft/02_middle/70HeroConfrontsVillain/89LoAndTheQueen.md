SUMMARY: Lo meets the Queen, gains her approval, flees.

The woman entered the library thrugh a private entrance--more than private, secret. 

Head down, earphones on, Lo didn't notice as the woman entered the library through a private entrance. She continued annotating the paper in front of her, pencil scratching lightly and rythmically. 

The woman drifted to stand behind Lo, silent. She was hugely pregnant. Something about her made it seem as if she were always pregnant--the way she carried her weight, perhaps, a general sense of exhaustion and peaceful resignation.  Lo smelled something rich, like butter and sugar melted together. 

She moved around the big hexagonal table, entering Lo's field of vision intentionally. She waited for Lo to notice her. 

When the song on her headphones ended, Lo took a flurry of notes--flipping pages, pencil moving quickly. She hummed a few notes over and over, slightly changing them until she seemed to settle on a version. 

The woman smiled and pulled a chair out. She sat and Lo started, thinking the grumpy librarian had come to scold her again. Aside from Fi, who in her sunny and vulnerable way had a hard time sneaking up on Lo, no one much visited the library and Lo had started treating the space as her own personal office. 

This woman's casual, commanding demeanor made it very clear the library did not belong to Lo.

Lo set her pencil down, pulled the headphones down to circle her neck, and folded her hands over the sheet music, using all the old tricks to settle her surprise.  She hadn't felt any signs of Delving, though she had to concede that she hadn't exactly been on her guard.

[Ed note: We know already there's a danger to the song she's writing, and that her work may well betray the Delvers. So we know she's hiding something here.]

The stared across the table at one another, Lo's grey eyes meeting their own reflection in the customary glasses, both faces stilled from much practice.

The woman spoke first. 

"Hello, Lo." (I probably don't always need the greeting, huh.) ~Something in her affect made~ Lo felt like she ought to know who this woman was--she seemed to expect deference or at least familiarity. Lo scanned her memory of the Council--there had been no pregnant women there, none with the elaborately braided red hair this woman had.  Her hair did remind Lo of Fi's hair...in fact, her face held more than a passing resemblance to Fi's--

"I've heard about your work here," she said, and Lo felt an unexpected wash of pride. Why should this woman affect her so? She didn't feel the tingling, but she began to suspect this woman had some other form of control over her.

Lo, struggling to cool the fulsh on her face, tiedied the papers under her hands, and sensing htewoman was looking at htem, casually placed them face down when she was done.  "I hope they've been good things?" she responded. 

The woman didn't answer. "How have things been going, Lo?"

"It's lonely," she blurted. "I mean, it's lonely being down here so much."

"It is lonely." The woman took off her glasses and Lo saw the irises of her eyes were hexagonal--it gave the woman a subtly otherworldly look.  Lo struggled to contain herself--this was the queen. It must be. [Ed note: Does Lo actually realize this?]

"I have placed great hope in you. Not everyone at the Well agrees with my faith in you, but they have not seen what I have seen. And they respect my sight, if not my interpretation of it. They are scared you will betray us."

~Lo had no idea what to say, who this woman was, or what she was talking about.~ She began to feel fear, crushing her briefly, eyes looking towards the empty desk the librarian used.  She was alone here with this woman and had no idea what would happen next.  They must have learned waht she was working on. 

The woman looked directly in Lo's eyes and a wave of relaxation swept away the fear. "I see the rot rising among us, Lo. I see it like you do. And I..." she trailed off, gestured vaguely at herself, "am not able to handle it." 

"They trust my sight. They trust my blood.  But they don't trust me.  They don't know the danger you bring, Lo, not even those who suspect you."

Lo just nodded, too afraid to speak.  [This scene needs to be clearer. The relationship between Queen and Lo, and Queen and others...it can be expanded on for sure. ]

The woman reached for the headphones. "I want to hear it."

Caught in the moment, Lo passed the headphones to her, knowing the song could kill this woman--in some ways, Lo realized she had in fact been building a massive weapon. She just hadn't expected the first victim to volunteer. She wanted to warn her but found she was unable to stop herself from handing the headphones over.  Lo knew two things to be true: first, she'd be in a real pickle if a dead pregnant woman was found in the library (if the queen was found dead at her work station) and second, she couldn't say no to this woman.  She didn't want her to suffer, but if she told this woman how dangerous it was, she would have to leave the Well, disappear altogether.  And the bad guys would win. 

Her finger hesitated over the play button. "I should tell you--"

"Lo, I know what you've been doing. I know the risks." Her face showed amusement, almost. Lo felt that itch that she should know who this woman was. And then she hit play. 

---

Lo waited anxiously in the silent library, eyes locked on the woman across the table from her. The woman closed her eyes to listen, glasses discarded on the table. The faint noise of the recorder spooling out the tape, and the sounds of their breath were all Lo could hear.  The butter and sugar smell had disappeared, replaced with a green smell, mud and new growth.  

The woman began singing along, her voice hoarse, reedy--almost nasal.  It was easily the worst singing voice Lo had ever heard, a shocking change from her warm and supple speaking voice--but the woman did follow the melody. And something about this raw voice, this voice that never got used, overwhelmed Lo with a feeling of sorrow. 

Lo looked down at the table, she thought about running, she thought about holding this woman, but instead she just sat there with the sheet music in her hands.  As she listened, the woman kept singing. Her face grew flushed, and sweat appeared near her hairline.  By the end of the song, she was gasping for breath, hands grabbing the table fiercely. She tries to speak but slumps in the table. 

Somewhere far away in the Well, there are shouts, carrying faintly into the library. 

With some effort, the woman  raised her head and looked directly in Lo's eyes.  Lo held her gaze, and barely notices the woman's eyes beginning to dilate. Suddenly the woman's eyes are almost black.  Lo feels deep love, hope for the future. She sees the old tree, surrounded by hooded figures--the tree ceremony as Fi described it to her.  She sees a great library, not empty and hidden underground like this one, but enormous, full of life and light, dozens of people working diligently together. At last she sees herself in the library, with that little bird that has been following her around perched there on her shoulder. She is standing in front of a large group of children, who are all singing this song she's been working on.  

Suddenly the images are replaced with a single word: "Run".  Lo is shocked to see the woman's head loll back as her eyes shut. Her face goes slack.  Lo jumps back and then moves in close. She is still breathing, she must have just passed out.  Lo looks around uncertain of what to do next, and then begins to hear voices in the hallway--angry voices. The shouts are much closer. 

She gathers her papers, the portable recorder, and turns away from the main exit.  A door she never noticed is cracked behind her--it must be where the woman came in.  Lo rushes towards it as she hears the main door slam open. The angry librarian yells when she sees the queen, and then roars Lo's name.  

#TODO: I THINK THE SONG IS TO COUNTERACT THE FUNGUS.  SHE DOESN'T REALIZE IT WILL KILL PEOPLE? NAH, THAT WRECKS THE TENSION OF THE WHOLE THING.  SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN BUT IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE GOOD.


#TODO: FI'S EXPERIENCE OF THE ABOVE AS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S CHILDREN.  HOW SHE RECOVERS AND ESCAPES. SHE HAS TO FIGHT UN ONE LAST TIME.
