The well looked like a beehive, really. Standing tall, circular, slope-shouldered from this angle, each level smaller than the one below it. 

Maybe it looks more like honeycomb. Modular rooms, built hexagonally, the interior core a massive water reservoir--they caught rainwater and stored it in the center of the building. Each open roof surface was covered with a garden of herbs and flowers. 

Smaller buildings, also hexagonal, surrounded the main structure--six of them, and weaving out from those, complicated paths, gardens, hillocks of dirt that sometimes proved to have doors set into them-. It was natural only in the way nature takes complex, geometrical forms, a seires of patterns scaling up and down, repteated in teh shape of a building or the placement of tile.  It was natural only in the way it was fractal, for everything here had been shaped by human hands. 

The effect was dizzying to Lo--the smell of the flowers, the bird song, the low level humming Lo couldn't identify and something just...Delverish. All just made the head swim. 

She finally recognized the feelings rising in her--she had come home.  She was finally here. 

NOTES: Devler sunglasses are hexagonal
