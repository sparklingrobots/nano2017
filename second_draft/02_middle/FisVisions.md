SUMMARY: Lo and Fi unpack her visions.


Let's write about how the song comes together: 

The next morning when Lo woke up she could hear a bird singing outside her window. She could also hear someone cooking in the kitchen.  ""

"Good morning, Fi."

"I hope you don't mind that I made breakfast for us. I figured we have a lot to do."

Fi's eternal helpfulness was slightly unnerving.  Lo was used to a communal spirit, but Fi's energy was boundless when it came to helping others. 

"Sure."  Lo grabbed her notebook.  "Okay, so what do we have?"

"We have the original vision." Fi spoke quickly and quietly on that. 

"Describe it to me again, Fi." 

"Okay, so, I felt the...intrusion in the tree, and then, like I blinked and woke up somewhere else, I was at the tree but everything was different.  The tree was alive but also on fire. I was there and I was in a circle around the tree.  A circle of ..." they paused to think.  "Six people." 

"You're sure it was six?" 

"Yes, it was six.  We all wore some strange kind of robes, and we were singing to the tree."

"Do you remember any part of the song?" Lo tried not to push too hard. 

"I....I can try. I don't have the best voice."

"Nonsense, all I need is what you have."

Fi sang quietly and hesitantly. The melody was not familiar to Lo. 

_Stay with us, grow tall with us._
_Two lines, one reward._

The two lines were separated by a few bars without words. 

"Does this mean anything to you, Fi? These words, or this melody? Do you know them?"

"Well, the..." it was still a struggle for her to speak of the Delvers' secrets here with Lo. "The melody is one of our most sacred songs, or close to it, at least."

Lo wrote furiously in her notebook.  "Sing the Delver song for me, please." she said curtly as she wrote. 

Fi wanted to protest but Lo's manner was so brusque she didn't feel she could.  So she started singing, a bit more confidently: 

_We heal with us, we grow with us._
_One line, one reward._ 
_Other bastardized lines that indicate they are trying to hard._

"When do you sing this song?"

"We sing it altogether as a sort of protection for the Well.  We surround..." Fi trailed off. They hadn't made the connection to how they circled the Well the way the vision had circled the Tree.  "It's a kind of...a spell for protection, and also a spell for fortitude." 

"Interesting. Everyone sings it?"

"Ideally we're all there, all the living Delvers of that Well.  But most of the time one or two people can't make it.  It's considered...bad form to miss very often.  You need a good excuse."

"When do you sing it, like what time of year? How often?"

"We sing it on all the holy days.  And sometimes if something bad happens, like if an important Delver dies. Or..." Fi stopped. "Well, those are the main times we use it."

"What else can you tell me about it?"

Fi looked off to the side, something Lo could only barely see with the reflective glasses.  

"I hate that song."

Lo waited.

"I hate singing that song; it's one of my least favorite things to do as a Delver." After a long pause, Fi resumed. "It feels....wrong somehow.  It feels fake and weird. Not how the song felt in my vision; that felt powerful and a little scary.  The song I know feels like...it feels like it was translated to another language and then back to English.  But it's so important that no one will even acknowledge that it might be weird.  All the Wells have their own songs, their own most powerful songs, I don't know the others.  But this one is ours and something just doesn't seem right to me about."

Lo tapped the paper with the back of her pen.  

"Have you ever had a vision like this before?"

Fi's extremely pale cheeks flushed a deep splotchy red when Lo asked.  "No, not like that.  I have visions a lot though, it's the only thing I have that's special."

"I can tell when the plants are thirsty, or need shade.  I can basically talk to them, but not in words. I can just sink into the soil and the root structure and...I don't know, it just makes sense to me what I should do next."  

"And sometimes I can see things the plant has 'seen', if you will." The flush in Fi's cheeks deepened. "But never anything like this.  It's like a little flash or short movie.  This was like...it was like the real world disappeared entirely. It was like I time travelled or something." 

"What kinds of things have you seen?"

"Just, you  know, things that happened in the garden.  Conversations, or whatever."

Lo felt suspicious but didn't push harder. [NOTE: Fi totally saw somebody from the Delvers, a powerful Delver, having sex with another student. Possibly coercive sex, almost certainly not ok given power differentials. And she felt both disgusted and envious.  She never told anybody but it formed the seed from which her fear and distaste of her fellow Delvers erupted.]

"Okay, so. We have six people, singing to the tree. A song you know but you don't know.  "

"And the robes."  

"What were the robes like? Did they seem important?"

Fi gestured at the notepad and Lo passed it over.  Fi started drawing--they were clearly not a visual artist but the idea got across.  Long red things, lots of flowing lightweight fabric, with a curious symbol on the back of it.  

"Did they all have this symbol?"

"I could only see the back of one...one of the singers came to the tree itself, stopped singing....and then finally they turned around and went back to their place.  So when they walked back I could see the symbol."

Fi hopped up to get the breakfast before it started to burn.  As they scooped the browned sweet potatoes and eggs onto Lo's plain brown plates, they did not speak. 

Lo was looking for the crack.  She needed to have the right question, the right theory--something to guide her search. 

Fi slid a plate in front of her and waited. 

"Do you have any theories, Fi?" Sometimes it was easiest to just ask. 

"I think...I got the sense that the song was a sort of protection or containment song. I got the sense that these people would sing it to the tree to keep that...thing inside of it.  Whatever it is that's inside that tree.

"And I think if we could do that song again, I think it would help contain...whatever it is that's going on."

I know someday you'll be the star in somebody else's sky, but why can't it be mine?
