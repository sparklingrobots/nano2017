Summary: Fi makes a decision to betray the Delvers by revealing their technology to Lo.

Fi seethed as they walked down the hall to fetch the files.  The others were alsways treating her like a servant. It wasn't fair that they had been here so long and never been welcomed into the council.

They walked down the hall without thinking, heading straight to the Archives.  Normally if a Delver met another Delver, they would either seal off their emotions or the two Delvers would pause to help the angry one reach a type of equilibrium--but since the incident at the tree, they hadn't been able to do either with her so this Delver at the archives simply avoided eye contact and disappeared into the stacks. 

Fi used to love the archives.  The wood paneling on the wall was warm, and it was so quiet there.  They used to go look at all the botany books the Delvers kept on hand--it wasn't a college library or anything but they needed books to teach the children until they were ready to move into the world.  And Fi learned the names of all the plants around her, and then they learned the names of all the plants they had in the books.  They read books about the historical uses of plants, about ethnobotany, about food and medicine uses.  It was a good place but once she was old enough they asked her not to come to the Archives for pleasure anymore. 

Just another example of how they didn't really think she had much to offer.  But this time was different. Fi had always known they were special and had mostly beeen content to let the other Delvers ignore her--the plants were there for her.  They didn't notice how verdant the gardens Fi tended were. Always it was a good growing season and Un never noticed that Fi was the one constant--even in years of bad weather, floods or droughts, she could grow a decent crop.  But because she wasn't as good with people as with plants they found her just barely tolerable. 

The Archivist returned and handed the file over to Fi without looking at her.  She took the file, feeling her resolve stiffen as she walked back down the hall. She would solve this problem and they'd have to see her value.  She would do it or she would never come back here.

A new (possibly alternate scene): 

(probably Fi is angry as she heads down there) 

Fi headed down to the Archives. All those years of reading here left her with a warm feeling about this part of the Well, untainted with all the frustrations and hurt feelings she had in the rest of the Well.  Here, she'd been able to study plants for hours during winter. All the plants around them came so naturally to her, she never needed to learn anything about them aside from their names. But there were so many plants she'd likely never see--plants from the tropics or the deserts. Prickly pear, kelp, Japanese red maple...the library had more plants than she'd be able to know about. She read about the way humans had used these plants, the chemical make-up of them, everything she could get her hands on.  

And none of the others ever came down here, especially not Un.  This was not a place of social importance or political power, it was quiet, a retreat.  

Now she was here for a different reason--helping Lo with the song. 

Seeing Lo bent over her notes, the black band of her headphones breaking a path through her dark brown curls, Fi felt some of the rage lift. 

Fi was beginning to suspect some things about the work Lo was doing.  She kept replaying the vision in her mind--she'd thought it was literal, but she was beginning to think it was more metaphorical.  FOr some reason she was growing convinced that the tree, burning in the center of their singing, was not the actual tree--but was instead the Queen.  And that Lo's song would be the key that destroyed the Queen. 

The thought was unsettling to Fi.  She wasn't personally close to the Queen--had almost never met her (or maybe never had met her)--but she felt always the tie between them (OOOH MAYBE THEY ARE INOCULATING WITH THE FUNGUS AS CHILDREN). They were all taught, of course, that the Queen was the most sacred and secret element of their society. The queen was the one who calmed them all, who controlled the Delvers--and the Delvers, in turn, were the greatest and most effective peace keepers the world had known.  

Fi wasn't even sure if the Queen was real. But the love she felt in their connection seemed real. She didn't know what it was like to have a parent, but the love she got from the Queen was the closest thing she could imagine to parental love.  

Fi remembered a time, as a child, when she said something to a friend (name the friend): she had said she believed she was one of the true daughters of the queen.  She'd heard the queen loved plants, too, had grown a secret garden in the heart of the Well full of exotic plants that would never grow this far north.  Fi knew deep within her they must be really truly mother and child then. 

And Mq had tattled on her, resulting in a humiliating lecture in front of the others--that all of us were the children of the queen, whether or not we were biologically her children, and that it was dangerous to pretend that one of us was better than the others.  

For a society that was so sanctimonious with its children, there sure was a lot of hierarchy in the adults.  Mq had, naturally, grown into a leadership position over time.  They were close to the queen, visiting her in the center of the Well every week to gain her leadership. Fi had only ever seen her at a distance. 

When she was farther from the well, the connection between them weakened--and it was a relief, really, not to have to feel that tug all the time.  Fi felt she could have her own life, her own wishes, when she was in town.  Here at the Well, the world closed down into three truths: Fi's love of plants was somewhere between irrelevant and immoral, Fi would never fit in, and Fi was stupid for trying. At the Well, she closed herself down so intensely she had a hard time focusing or hearing anything at all.  

And now Lo was here, working on this cure for the Delvers, and Fi couldn't be shut down the way she normally was. She felt Lo's feelings, and besides her own control and connection with the queen had been so badly damaged that she didn't have her normal control.  Lo's presence was the only thing grounding her. 

And Lo had no idea what the song she was workign on would actually do.
