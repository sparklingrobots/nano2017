The Well, Day 5

I'm growing used to the room they've given me--even starting to feel my way around without getting lost. Sort of. 

The library is incredible. Oh the library...to have something like this, it's beyond imagining.  The music history is so deep.  

I started crying last night as I was getting toward the end of the day. This old song--gospel-era--was so gorgeous--these voices together, praise and joy all at once--the earliest form of the singing we do now. 

The song itself was magnificent and when I finally cried myself out, I felt this roughness, this rough start. How could they keepy this to themselves? They have what they need, I don't understand. 

(NOTE: omg the well is earthships)
(omg everyone sings together at the end!)

The reasoning. but as soon as the rage started, someone delved me and of couse, it fasded. I don't know who did it but I susptect that grumpy ass librarian.  I swear she doesn't want me to be here. 

Join the club, honey.  Not the warmest place I've ever been. 


The Well, Day 6.
