SUMMARY: Lo goes to the Council of Delvers

Lo awoke the next morning with a headache.  She was in a lower level of the Well, in a room with several bunks but no one else she could see.  She didn't really remember much after her conversation with Un. And the peaceful feelings she'd been full of yesterday seemed entirely gone.  She felt clearer than she had in a very long time, but also...she felt a creeping sense of unease. 

She sat up and saw an insulated flask (presumably tea) and a note written on a single index card by hand, black ink:  

_When you're up, here's some tea for you, and a bit of food for you.  We'll come down for you when we're ready._

She dropped the note and poured herself a cup of tea.  Something unexpected had happened to her yesterday, to be sure, but she had no idea what.  She tore a roll in half and started spreading butter on the middle, then jam, then a piece of cheese.  Then she smashed them back together and ate them like a sandwich.  At least the food here was pretty decent. 

She had a large bite in her mouth when the door swung open.  It was yet another Delver she didn't know.  This one was wearing reflective glasses as well, but wore the robes she'd seen on so many here. 

"Good morning, Lo, how are you feeling?"

"Fine, thank you. What's your name?"

"I'm Zo, forgive my rudeness!" The Delver knew she wasn't fine but didn't say anything and restrained themselves from outputting any calmness.  "I've been sent to bring you upstairs for a meeting. Are you ready?"

Lo was already smearing jam on her second roll & adding the cheese, mouth still full from the first. She stood up, tea in one hand, breakfast in the other. "Lead on, Zo."

Zo almost asked her to leave the food but realized there was little point in it and little harm.  They followed some dark hallways until they found a staircase and headed up.  They went up four flights of stairs, Lo holding onto her breakfast as they climbed.  On the fourth floor, they entered a large chamber with a big hexagonal table in the center.  There were 17 Delvers in the room, three on each side of the table, with a spot for (she presumed) herself between Fi and Un.  Fi, for all their awkward lack of eye contact, brimmed with supportive friendliness.  The rest sat expectantly. 

"You might have warned me it was a formal gathering," she muttered to Zo. 

"It's....complicated." they said quietly, then cleared their throat, "I present Lo Ana Iuy to the Council of Delvers." then bowed and turned to leave.

Not a good sign when your host is as scared of your situation as you are.

TODO (maybe): Write about the actual Council of the Delvers--what do they say, what are they like? 

Un stood up and the other Delvers followed.  They took off their glasses and looked at her, except Fi and two other Delvers she hadn't seen right away, off to the side.  They sang a shining song that nearly seemed to pin her to the wall. 

_We need you here_
_We are so thankful._
_We will write songs for you._
_The threat is real and you are the protector._
_The wind is cold._ 
_The void grows large._

The word void woke her from the trance of the beautiful song.  The force of the Council working in concert was not something many ever experienced--they used it only for helping the other Delvers stay in sync, and non-Delvers were usually not able to withstand it.  But this one was different than any others. 

[con't from 2017.11.20.md]

Something about the way they said void had made her tremble--her stomach heaving. Her vision blacked out in the center of her eyes. The song was still reverberating in the large honeycomb shaped hall when her vision returned. 

Un felt for Lo, but also knew she was not someone to pity.  They had read her records, and it was clear she would be able to handle herself--well, no one could really handle themselves around the Delvers but she would be fine.  Still, only occasionally and with great preparation for the other had they ever done what they just did to Lo: a concentrated blast of gratitude wrapped around a core of fear and anxiety.  The fact that she was still standing showed her mettle.  Un was intrigued, to sya the least. 

"Lo, good to see you this morning." Un called out to her across the hall. "Join us, if you will."

Lo walked over to Un, hoping she looked more level than she felt.  "Quite a greeting you all put together."

A quiet round of laughter moved around the table as the Council moved to put their sunglasses back on and took their seats.  Lo smiled as she sat down.  She would not let them put her off. She would resist their powers as much as she could. 

[does lo have a special ability to retreat inside herself? does she know that she has it or is it instinctive?]

A person across the table stood up.  They were also tall--they looked perhaps like a sibling or close relative of Un.  Lo assumed the Delvers were genetically different from the general population so perhaps it was logical for them to look alike. "We are here because of a grave threat to the Delvers. We believe you'll be able to help us."

"Forgive me if I don't introduce all of us.  We needed everyone here for...well, reasons you'll come to see.  I trust Fi told you the basics?"

"They told me that something happened regarding that old tree out by the springs, and that it had...infected or damaged some of your Delvers. They said you needed help with the history of the area." 

"Indeed.  Fi came back damaged but relatively healthy.  The other two Delvers came back burned out.  They can no longer Delve, nor can they Receive."

They paused and looked around the council. Early morning light streamed through the windows onto the table and Lo wondered if she could get some coffee.

"We have things to tell you about the Delvers that non-Delvers are not allowed to know, but without this information you "

Actually maybe not. Maybe they withhold the info and that becomes part of the conflict.  

"We would like to send you to the tree to see "

"We have heard reports from distant Wells that some of their Delvers have disappeared. The "

TODO: This Council of Delvers scene is a mess and I don't know where to go with it.
