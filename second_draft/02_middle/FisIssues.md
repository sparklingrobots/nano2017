Summary: Fi has issues

It took Fi most of her adulthood to realize that she didn't actually love Un.  The idea that they had to love Un, all of them, the whole Well, had been hammered in from the start. Un protects the Well. Un taught hte Well. Un is the center of the Well.  But then she started to realize what it meant to love.  It meant asking questions.  It meant paying attention and expressing affection. It meant noticing.  Un never noticed Fi, not in a good way.

In some ways Fi couldn't believe how long it had taken them to realize that Un saw them as a mere tick in the ledger sheet, another piece of evidence in tribute to Un's own greatness.  Fi, themselves, didn't truly matter, at all.  In fact it seemed Fi had two purposes: Feed the Well, and fuck up.  If they fucked up, they actually got more attention from Un.  It was the only time Fi felt particularly close to Un, when they knew Un was muttering under their breath about Fi's mistakes, just as they'd heard Un do dozens of times when other Delvers did something bad or wrong.  

Mq would tell Fi that Un loved them.  Un talked about them all the time.  Fi felt a bit silly but they didn't believe a word of it. 

So when the message came, Fi felt pulled out to sea and flooded at the same time. 

"Lo, I....I have to go back to the Well."

"What's up?"

"They....they need me there. For a ceremony."

"I need you here, Fi.  I need you.  We're so close and...you saw the message on the bench."

Fi turned her head.  "I know. I know you need me and I know we need to work but I..."  They put their hands over their eyes. There were no tears forthcoming but they felt like there should be.  They wished they would come. 

"I don't have a choice, Lo."

Lo was furious.  She was scared and Fi was the only one she had left, since Su left on the radio mission. 

"You always have a choice, Fi.  You alsways have a choice."

Lo turned and walked out of the apartment.  That's when the tears came.

As Fi pedaled to the Well, that same familiar dilation and narrowing happening at the same time, their body seemed to evaporate as their soul condensed into a thick sludge, they refused to think about the options.  They just kept pedalling.  The trees were gorgeous and the sunset was remarkable--the sky a slightly gray blue with bright streaks of coral clouds in front, and the moon hanging large in the midst. The trees were barren now, the leaves all on the ground, so only the black branches reached into the colors of the sky. 

They pulled over at the little rest area, at the bottom of the valley.  Their legs were tired--not a good sign at the bottom of the valley, with the climb yet to come.  

They sat at the table and made a quick sandwich to snack on.  They loved this part of the journey, the ritualistic snacks, the wide open sky with the surprising clouds. They loved the solitude.  They loved, in some way, the Well.  It was where they'd been made, in all truth, for better or worse...without the gardens at the Well, would they ever have developed the talent with plants? 

They wondered if they would die at the Well, or if their body would have to be transported there.  

Lo's words came unbidden: "You always have a choice."

Fi laughed to herself.  Lo was right, but Lo also wasn't a Delver.  Lo didn't know what it was like.  Lo didn't have to feel the crushing emotional pressure when she didn't live up to their desires. 

But Lo could have been. Lo was sensitive. And Lo managed to say no. [TODO: Figure out a time when Lo denied the Delvers.]

Fi looked at the moon. They imagined the ceremony going on without them, and realized that they truly didn't matter.  Un would never know.  Mq may or may not know.  But now that she couldn't delve anyway, what difference did it make? 

Fi got on her bike and headed back toward Lo.  There was one place they were needed. And they would be there.

TODO: Fi needs to realize that the work they're doing will destroy the Delvers and go through with it anyway.
