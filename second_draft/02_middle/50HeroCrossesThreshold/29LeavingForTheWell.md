 Hx's face was ugly. The whole scene was ugly. They were curled up in the arm chair near the big sliding glass doors, shoulders hunched up, not looking at Lo but clearly not looking at anything else either. Their entire body spoke of pain, and self-protection, with the curvature of an uncracked walnut sitting alone. She wanted to go to them, to hug them and assure them it would be alright, but something stopped her. 

She returned to the kitchen, preparing her meals for the next day. The Delver messenger (or whoever) had warned her that the journey was most of a day, and without any supplied stops.  She dug out some cheese and dried summer sausage from the fridge, started slicing it and wrapping it in small wax paper packets.  She filled two water bottles and a third larger canteen for restock.  She put the sausage and the water back in the fridge, and then pulled out some nuts, some dried fruit, some crackers, and put it all in the side pocket of her pannier. 
She carried the bag to the patio, walking right by Hx.  Closing the door behind her, she bent to check tire pressure and to lube up the chain. She double-checked the small kit of bike tools she carried on longer journeys and added those to the pannier.   The other pannier was already packed with her clothing, her notebooks, and SOMETHING SENTIMENTAL. 
"Don't go." The tight voice, small from inside that chair, was both expected and not.  She'd never been able to reliably predict when Hx would emerge from this shelled state.  She looked at them, assessing. 
"You know I can't stay. I won't be gone that long."
"I haven't been alone." 
"Su will visit. You have friends. You'll go to the Delvers every week just like usual." 
"I need you." 
"Hx, you don't. You don't need me. You are fine. You are a great cook. You like all the people at the market. You have lots of friends here you can ask for support when you need it." 
Hx didn't say anything. 
"I won't be gone that long.  And it's important, Hx. You saw that Delver who came here the other night. You saw..." Lo grimaced. "You saw the way she was damaged.  We need the Delvers, Hx. And now they need me." 

After a long beat of silence, Lo opened herself up to Hx's feelings. She could feel the pain, a lot of fear.  She could feel a compulsiveness that spiralled into this locked-up state. She wanted the Delvers here, not in their stupid locked up hall, but here, where it mattered, when they were needed.  The edges of Hx's feelings were starting to feel ragged to her, starting to feel undone. 
She moved to stand behind the chair, put her hands on top of the high back. And she started to sing. 
It was the song she knew the Delvers used sometimes when she was in this state.
