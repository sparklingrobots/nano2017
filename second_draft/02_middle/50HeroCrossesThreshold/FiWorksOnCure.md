Fi didn't come out much that week. Being around people was like stones in her heart, or like an itching deep inside herself. And if she actually made contact, or tried to sing, it got real ugly.  There had been more fights in the Well since she returned than she had ever known.  

But she did spend a lot of time in the library and the gardens.  She felt newly strong with plants--having seen that pink energy from the willow, now she couldn't unsee it...although none of hte plants around her were infected.  

Climbing the tree had been a mistake, she supposed, given the fucked up nature she felt inside her now.  She felt frequently now bouts of irritability, anger even--aside from the fact that connecting with the other Delvers was nearly impossible (author's note: Fi was infected, but her internal compass is so strong that she is basically fighting with the fungus. The other infected Delvers just kinda turn and become bad). 

But she'd gotten a cutting. Willows are so easy to grow from cuttings, and this one still showed faint signs of the pink energy. She had known that bringing it into the Well would be....ill-fated given what had happened to her.  But she needed something to study.  So, aways off from the Well, she'd stuck the willow cutting into the ground. 

She knew, somehow that what was wrong with the tree was also wrong with her.  

With some Delvers, Fi starts to find that other Delvers are infected like she is--she starts to be able to sort out who is in the rebel faction with some visual or other sensory cue. This is what pushes her to Lo.
