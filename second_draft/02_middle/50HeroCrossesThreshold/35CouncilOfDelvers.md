SUMMARY: Lo goes to the Council of Delvers

Lo awoke the next morning with a headache.  She was in a lower level of the Well, in a room with several bunks but no one else she could see.  She didn't really remember much after her conversation with Un. And the peaceful feelings she'd been full of yesterday seemed entirely gone.  She felt clearer than she had in a very long time, but also...she felt a creeping sense of unease. 

She sat up and saw an insulated flask (presumably tea) and a note written on a single index card by hand, black ink:  

_When you're up, here's some tea for you, and a bit of food for you.  We'll come down for you when we're ready._

She dropped the note and poured herself a cup of tea.  Something unexpected had happened to her yesterday, to be sure, but she had no idea what.  She tore a roll in half and started spreading butter on the middle, then jam, then a piece of cheese.  Then she smashed them back together and ate them like a sandwich.  At least the food here was pretty decent. 

She had a large bite in her mouth when the door swung open.  It was yet another Delver she didn't know.  This one was wearing reflective glasses as well, but wore the robes she'd seen on so many here. 

"Good morning, Lo, how are you feeling?"

"Fine, thank you. What's your name?"

"I'm Zo, forgive my rudeness!" The Delver knew she wasn't fine but didn't say anything and restrained themselves from outputting any calmness.  "I've been sent to bring you upstairs for a meeting. Are you ready?"

Lo was already smearing jam on her second roll & adding the cheese, mouth still full from the first. She stood up, tea in one hand, breakfast in the other. "Lead on, Zo."

Zo almost asked her to leave the food but realized there was little point in it and little harm.  They followed some dark hallways until they found a staircase and headed up.  They went up four flights of stairs, Lo holding onto her breakfast as they climbed.  On the fourth floor, they entered a large chamber with a big hexagonal table in the center.  There were 17 Delvers in the room, three on each side of the table, with a spot for (she presumed) herself between Fi and Un.  Fi, for all their awkward lack of eye contact, brimmed with supportive friendliness.  The rest sat expectantly. 

"You might have warned me it was a formal gathering," she muttered to Zo. 

"It's....complicated." they said quietly, then cleared their throat, "I present Lo Ana Iuy to the Council of Delvers." then bowed and turned to leave.

Not a good sign when your host is as scared of your situation as you are.

TODO (maybe): Write about the actual Council of the Delvers--what do they say, what are they like? 

Un stood up and the other Delvers followed.  They took off their glasses and looked at her, except Fi and two other Delvers she hadn't seen right away, off to the side.  They sang a shining song that nearly seemed to pin her to the wall. 

_We need you here_
_We are so thankful._
_We will write songs for you._
_The threat is real and you are the protector._
_The wind is cold._ 
_The void grows large._

The word void woke her from the trance of the beautiful song.  The force of the Council working in concert was not something many ever experienced--they used it only for helping the other Delvers stay in sync, and non-Delvers were usually not able to withstand it.  But this one was different than any others. 

[con't from 2017.11.20.md]

Something about the way they said void had made her tremble--her stomach heaving. Her vision blacked out in the center of her eyes. The song was still reverberating in the large honeycomb shaped hall when her vision returned. 

Un felt for Lo, but also knew she was not someone to pity.  They had read her records, and it was clear she would be able to handle herself--well, no one could really handle themselves around the Delvers but she would be fine.  Still, only occasionally and with great preparation for the other had they ever done what they just did to Lo: a concentrated blast of gratitude wrapped around a core of fear and anxiety.  The fact that she was still standing showed her mettle.  Un was intrigued, to sya the least. 

"Lo, good to see you this morning." Un called out to her across the hall. "Join us, if you will."

Lo walked over to Un, hoping she looked more level than she felt.  "Quite a greeting you all put together."

A quiet round of laughter moved around the table as the Council moved to put their sunglasses back on and took their seats.  Lo smiled as she sat down.  She would not let them put her off. She would resist their powers as much as she could. 

[does lo have a special ability to retreat inside herself? does she know that she has it or is it instinctive?]

A person across the table stood up.  They were also tall--they looked perhaps like a sibling or close relative of Un.  Lo assumed the Delvers were genetically different from the general population so perhaps it was logical for them to look alike. "We are here because of a grave threat to the Delvers. We believe you'll be able to help us."

"Forgive me if I don't introduce all of us.  We needed everyone here for...well, reasons you'll come to see.  I trust Fi told you the basics?"

"They told me that something happened regarding that old tree out by the springs, and that it had...infected or damaged some of your Delvers. They said you needed help with the history of the area." 

"Indeed.  Fi came back damaged but relatively healthy.  The other two Delvers came back burned out.  They can no longer Delve, nor can they Receive."

They paused and looked around the council. Early morning light streamed through the windows onto the table and Lo wondered if she could get some coffee.

"We have things to tell you about the Delvers that non-Delvers are not allowed to know, but without this information you "

Actually maybe not. Maybe they withhold the info and that becomes part of the conflict.  

"We would like to send you to the tree to see "

"We have heard reports from distant Wells that some of their Delvers have disappeared. The "

TODO: This Council of Delvers scene is a mess and I don't know where to go with it.

Here is what we know so far. 

We won't cover what we learned from your excellent book on the subject.  But we believe there was a song used over the years to cleanse the tree, sort of. We don't know if it was a song of protection or removal.  We have a few songs in our records of songs from the group of Watchers, but none of them seem to be quite right. 

We think there may have been another entity involved, someone who was corrupting the watchers until they finally fell into ruin.  It seems like perhaps we have been lucky that nothing has happened before this--or perhaps Fi caused it by Delving the tree itself.  We don't know.  We've never encountered anything like this--a sentient tree, maybe. A powerful spell set on the tree, perhaps.  But we have members of every Well within a 500 mile radius and they all have had problems starting the night of Fi's vision. 

Lo waited.  "I'm sorry but, really? A vision? That's what we're going on here."

Un glanced at the oldest person at the table. They nodded. 

"Lo, what we're about to tell you is known only to Delvers. If you share this information outside the Delvers, well, we don't know what will happen to you but we know that it would bring ruin to the Delvers."

"We've been engaged in a multigenerational program of selecting extraordinarily sensitive people and training them to use those senses in ways that normal humans are not able to. And, while we don't force anything, we encourage marriage and child-rearing among Delvers who wish to do so to increase the sensitivity of our kind even further.

Over the centuries of doing this work, we've found some extraordinarily talented individuals--and we've learned to trust their instincts.  The information they sense manifests in strange ways, as visions that are sometimes literal and sometimes simply a warning processed into a more abstract form by their subconscious.  And each of these Delvers tends to specialize in certain ways.  Fi's specialty is, was..." they paused "plant-related. From a young age they were an exceptional gardener, able to heal almost any unhappy plant. They used to report stories from the plants, and gradually we've been able to hone it into a very powerful ability.

"So, yes. Yes, we are going off a vision. It's what we've done for centuries and it's what we'll continue to do."

Lo glanced at Fi, who looked at her directly now that she had glasses on. She remembered the dark visions she had received from Fi the first time they'd met. Lo looked at Un, and then scanned the Council slowly. 

"You want me to find a song."

"We want you to find a song and we want you to sing it at the site of the tree. We can't risk any more Delvers going there.  Bring in the damaged Delvers."

Two figures emerged from the far side of the room, guided benevolently by an older person.  They seemed to struggle to walk in a straight line; the guide held each by a shoulder and walked slowly to keep them relatively on track.  They wore a different color of robe and very large reflective goggles. 

"Fi came back unable to properly Delve and to connect people.  These two..." Un sounded truly sad for the first time.  "These two are now dangerous, with the skill of a Delver but they seem infected by a desire to disrupt and scare people instead of bringing us together. They...they nearly caused some discord here at the Well before Fi realized what was happening.

"We think this may be what happened to the missing Delvers. We don't have proof that it did, but the type of reports we're getting from the communities where they went missing show bizarrely clicquish, tribal behavior.  The sort of thing Delvers are trained to prevent. So now we're spreading from the healthy wells out to the weakened ones, trying to stop the spread of this...virus and we can't risk any more good Delvers at the spring. We need you, Lo.

It was the second time this week Lo had heard anything other than serenity and unity from the mouth of a Delver.
