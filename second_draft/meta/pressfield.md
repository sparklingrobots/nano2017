What are the 8 to 12 sequences (can be made of multiple scenes) in the book?


# Hero's Journey

ACT ONE
1. hero starts in ordinary world

Lo and her friends are in the forest preparing for the year's big harvest. All the Delvers are here, it's a big chaotic time. The inciting incident is witnessed by all but only understood by fi and Lo. (murder? harvest spoiled? leader killed or corrupted? climax embedded. it has to happen at the spring. )

2. hero receives call to adventure


3. hero rejects call

Lo runs from the scene of the crime. She tries to push it from her mind, assuming the Delvers will address it and calm everyone--but the ongoing silence from the Delvers drives her to extreme distress/anxiety.

4. hero meets mentor. mentor gives hero courage to continue

Fi comes to Lo with a summoning from the Delvers--Fi shares her fear and bolsters Lo's courage. 

ACT TWO -- Act Two belongs to the VILLAIN. Make sure the villain is front and center all the dang time. 

5. hero crosses threshold, enter special world.

Fi and Lo travel to the Well

6. hero encounters enemies and allies, undergoes ordeal that will serve as their initiation

Lo meets lots of Delvers, and begins to understand more about the world of the Delvers and starts to see the dark side of them. She meets both good and bad Delvers and experiences two things: 

1) She is threatened by a Delver, or has other scary Delver experience.
2) Council of Delvers, initiating her into their ranks so she can do her work. 

(OMG MAYBE LO DOES ALL THE RESEARCH IN THE WELL AND NOT AT HER OWN HOME, HENCE SHE GETS A LOT OF TIME TO SPEND WITH THEM AND LEARN ABOUT THE BADNESS) (POSSIBLY ALSO WHY SU HAS TO GO ON HER BIKE RIDE?)

7. hero confronts villain, acquires treasure

As Lo finishes her song and prepares to share it with the Delvers, she is waylaid by the Bad Delvers, who try to kill her and destroy her work. 

ACT THREE

8. the road back. hero escapes special world, trying to 'get home'

She runs away from the Well. Fi and a few other Delvers flee with her. They need to find a new way to broadcast since the Well is destroyed in the escape (fire?) (everyone deafened or otherwise wounded?)

9. villains pursue hero. hero must fight/escape again. 

They follow!  Perhaps they take refuge in the old hotel, or perhaps they simply end up there via hijinks.

10. hero returns home with treasure, reintegrates into ordinary world, but now as changed person, thanks to their ordeal and experiences on the journey

After escaping, Lo and co. finally unleash the song, fighting off the bads.  Not only is Lo changed, but the whole world is undone--and time for a new beginning.
