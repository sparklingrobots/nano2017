Inspirations: 

* Bicyclists were responsible for the paving of America, which then led to the car. So a) we need to keep the roads up, and b) all technology has a down side. 

* Robert McNamara. Someone in Vietnam said that he believed there was an answer to everything--and that was his downfall. Who is like that in the story? And also, what in general can be taken from the Vietnam war? The endless confusion of friend and enemy, the arrogance of leadership -- truly believing they were leading us into a better future. It feels relevant.  But not sure how or why, exactly.  

* Emergent Strategy.
