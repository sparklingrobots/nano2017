Fi felt like broken glass. She had a vague sense that a week or so had passed while she was in here, but not any clear sense of what was going on.

She lay still, eyes open.  When the nurse came in, she turned her head to face her and the nurse shrieked and spilled the water in her hand.  She rushed out of the room, Fi could almost feel her fear as she told the other nurses that Fi was awakw, was she okay was she okay she looked at her, would she be okay? Fi had no idea what to make of that. 

Another nurse came in and bent down to clean up the water, avoiding looking at Fi again, Fi reached up to her own face, wondering what had scared the nurse...everything seemed normal--a few scabs, it seemed, maybe those looked worse than they felt? The nurse left and Fi could hear murmurings in the hall.  She put her head back down and rolled away from the door. 

Several minutes later, the door reopened and whoever entered was clearly more prepared for whatever was wrong with Fi.  Their voice was restrained, calm, as they made small talk.  Fi didn't turn back to them and they didn't ask her to. 

"Porridge here by your bedside, if you're hungry."

Fi waited until the door closed and then rolled over, sat up with a good push and a cringe.  The porridge was hot, good. She loved porridge and they'd made it the way she liked it.  It was good to be home, sometimes. 

The memories came back as she rummaged backward in time.  She remembered being here in the hospital.  She remembered someone...someone visiting her at night, though not who or why. Maybe just one of the nurses, though her memories had them in something other than the nursing garb.  Which we still need to describe.  The nurses wore close-fitted outfits of green, mostly, with some blue. The infirmary was below ground and always a bit cool, so they tended to wear long sleeves and long pants.  They had a special robe and badge for when formal ceremonies were happening, but none of them wore that today.  The one who tended Fi wore a knit cap to hold her hair in. 

She sought for older memories, and there was a lot of blankness...she remembered with a shock the vision of the tree, the fluorescent energy flowing up and out of it. Falling out of the tree. And then the long ride home, just her and her bicycle. She stopped overnight, near a shelter she usually would have stayed in...but she didn't want to see anyone just yet.  She knew something dangerous was happening, she knew, somehow, that she might run into the wrong person out here.  She found a shallow overhang a few hundred yards away and collapsed there for the night.  

When she woke in the morning, she forced herself to drink some water and then began the last flight to the Well. She fell several times, her body unwilling to listen to her mind in the state it was in.  She felt compelled to get to the Well, to warn Un and the others, but there was another thread...she couldn't look directly at it, but there was a desire in her to destroy.  It was a feeling she'd never really known, even at her angriest, and it was only something physical that got her to the Well--habit, perhaps, or wisdom buried deep inside her. 

She couldn't remember getting to the hospital. She didn't know what, if anything, she had said.

She was still scraping the last bits of porridge when Zo came inside the room. Fi would have expected, perhaps, Un to visit or one of the gardeners. Zo....she barely knew Zo.  

Zo wore her glasses and trained her eyes on the floor--unsettling. Fi had never seen Zo or any of the Three with anything less than a regal posture.  She moved toward Fi and held her hand out.  Fi reached out and realized she was being handed a pair of lenses.  She took them and put them on, it was the obvious thing. 

Once they were on, she said, voice cracking, "Hello, Zo. Good day to you and all the Well."

Zo let her gaze drift upward until she could confirm that the glasses were on Fi's face out of her peripheral vision, then straightened her back and look directly at Fi.  Fi sat patiently, unsure why they were both lensed here in the Well together. 

The two of them wait a moment, Fi in her bed, red hair mussed from days in bed, Zo standing near the door, wearing something other than her formal robes. They both knew the forms--come together, hold hands briefly, attune to one another--but Fi as the lesser one, as the one in a hospital bed--she didn't feel comfortable with that.  And Zo stayed quite far. 

Fi realized that Zo was wearing gloves, anyhow. 

"Fi. So good to see you awake." The warmth in Zo's voice was very welcome, but Fi just nodded. 

"I'm sorry for....this. I'm sorry for this greeting.  We think...there have been some incidents since you came back and we are taking some precautions. I'm sure you understand they are necessary..."

"What incidents?" 

"We've...a few nurses have been injured by direct contact with you. Gloves seem to help, as long as they are thick and not leather.  We aren't sure about the eye contact, but some of the injured nurses have had issues with eye contact. So we're just playing it safe."

What I actually wanted this scene to be: Showing Fi fighting off the infection. Because she *was* infected by the tree--in addition to receiving the vision--which now that I think about it should be from the tree's perspective, and not a vision in the way that human eyeballs would see it. But something like Fi feels she is suddenly enormous, she has arms beyond counting, and fingers beyond that.  She cannot move, she feels herself grown deep into the ground, she is drinking from a spring at her feet.  She feels, in her side, an acute pain, a wound, it's bleeding but she can't reach down to touch it.  She realizes none of the birds are here, they have left, and she hears a new kind of song...seven voices calling up from the ground. The wind is strong, it blows the song around and up.  She can feel this song around her, weaving together, coming closer to her--wrapping itself up against her. It doesn't cure the wound, no--it doesn't cure it at all.  But it does stop the bleeding.  Whatever made the wound is still inside her, and she groans mightily.  The song grows louder in response, and then it finishes.  She can tell the source of the song are seven humans, seven of those robed people who harvest the bubbleweed on the good years, but she doesn't have the resolution needed to see faces. 

As Fi interprets the vision, she realizes that these are....this vision must be old.  The robes are not like we wear now, but a rough version of it.
