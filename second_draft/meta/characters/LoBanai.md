Lo (LoAna) Banai. 

Born 2731. 

What does she want? 

Lo appears to be quite settled in her life, participating in the social rituals like harvests and cooking with no issues.  She does, however, have a deep wish that she had been chosen for the Delvers. She ignores it as best she can, trying to move on and live her own life, but there's always a nagging sense that she was passed over unfairly.  

She lives in a small apartment building and is relatively happy there. She moves the furniture a lot, and decorates with things she finds out on her explorations. Leaves, interesting stones, bird feathers--lots of bird feathers.  Su lives nearby; her "parents" live in another town now and she doesn't see them much. 

Her last name is something she awards herself when the book is finished--everyone picks their own last names after the Delvers collapse.

Formative things in her life: 

She went on a hike with a class in 7th grade -- the year she met Su. That teacher taught her the name of a few birds in the area -- the canyon wren, 

What does she wear? 
She wears loose pants, lots of purple and blue and brown.  Her clothes are not important to her. 

What are her explorations?
She likes to go hiking by herself, so she can sing her own songs without getting in trouble. She doesn't exactly realize this is what she's doing, but she has a deep fear of sharing those songs (unknowingly from a childhood incident where she was punished severely). 


~She doesn't want children (in fact there seem to be no children really in this world), that's Delver business.~  She lives in a mix of fear and excitement that the Delvers will ask her to bear children, but given her age it seems unlikely (she's 32).  Mostly she wants that because it would redeem her sense that she could have been part of them.  (I dunno, would this be a fun angle to bring into the book?) 

Who is she in relationships with? 

She is close to Su (who needs a character as well).  They've known each other since they were about 12 years old and have been close ever since. 

Io is an ex-lover she sees around from time to time. 

Her parents died a long time ago, she never really knew them and instead was raised by her "aunt" and "uncle". I'm realizing I have like zero ability to give Lo any parental figures at all and I don't know why. 

She goes to singing groups all the time but isn't particularly close to the people who attend particularly because of Delvers. 

# Mental Health
Lo is somewhat mentally ill, she goes to the Delvers a lot for mood adjustments.  This mental illness is also part of her skills and why she can defend herself against delving.
