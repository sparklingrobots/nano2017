Lo is the primary care-taker for Hx. Hx's diagnosis is not shared, but both Lo and Hx have to go to the Delvers for calibration pretty regularly and always have. Not everyone does this. 

Su is also a care-taker for Hx, due to their closeness to Hx. 

Lo perceives that she can actually do what the Delvers do for Hx. For some reason the songs they sing to her don't work if she sings them to herself. This is her latent/wild power--so natively gifted that she can pick up the Delver skills without training.  This is also why the Delvers excluded her--they felt she would be too strong.

When Lo is summoned to the Delvers to work on the song, does Hx have to come with her? I like her being able to "practice" on Hx, but there's something about the isolation and removal.  

Right now, the time at the Well is really unformed. Su does AND doesn't come to the Well with Lo. Same with Hx. 

If Su and Hx don't come to the Well, then what? How does Lo communicate with them? What about the scene where Su goes to the neighboring town and sees something bad? Is that just a standalone scene that Su doesn't know anything about? Are there letters or other communications between the Well and elsewhere? Would those be read by the Delvers? 

I do think there's something about Hx being left alone, Lo wondering about them, having to decide on her own. But she doesn't get the opportunity to "practice" on them without them being around. Does she go home for a break for some reason?
