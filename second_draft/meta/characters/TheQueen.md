 The Queen 

She was given a birth name, when it wasn't yet known she was the next Queen. It was Honor Bruce, or Una, or Jacqueline. I don't know which one yet. She was raised as Una until the age of three when they decided she would be next. The first three years of her life, the uncontrolled flood of connection and emotion, were terrifying. She was difficult as a result, crying frequently and sometimes lashing out empathically. 

The queen is about 30 years old -- she is the product of a long breeding program, like her mother before her.  They are raised and live in relative isolation, but due to their empathic powers they are relatively able to know what is going on with the other Delvers. 

She is more or less constantly pregnant -- at 30, she has birthed at least 11 children.  She has no partner, it's mostly invitro fertilization and similar (or, hell, I dunno, maybe sexy times ARE involved.)

As a girl, she was always withdrawn and distant publicly, and she has continued that into adulthood. She speaks rarely, and is frequently cryptic. 

That said, what's the human side of the Queen? 

She deeply believes in the Well, in its commitment to peace and emotional regulation, but has also come to understand that the level of control it demands is a fatal flaw.  She sees the ways that restricting access to their tools generates an over-reliance in the population, leading to no one with the skills to balance the Delvers. 

When Lo was brought to the Well as a child, another Delver had a vision of Lo's future -- saw the Well full of bodies, people lying limp in the halls, and Lo at the center of the chaos.  The Queen had Lo brought to her and saw a more complete version of the vision--kept watching without turning away--and saw that while Lo would destroy the Well she would also restore the people their own latent powers.  Over the next several years, the Queen begins to see how the Well is bad and wants Lo to succeed.  

Still, she keeps the end of the vision to herself, and allows them to send Lo away.  She knows that Lo is an outsider and must remain so.  She also senses that Lo would be incredibly powerful if trained and may become corrupted. 

Still, we are not yet at the human side of the Queen. The part of Elizabeth who really likes Phillip and horses and wishes she didn't have to chat so much with important people. The human side is deeply buried, the Queen herself sometimes forgets about the other parts of her, lost always in the growing of new children who are quickly taken from her and raised for others. She knows her connection to the Well is important, and she both loves and loathes the structure all together. 

She is not a very good singer.  She has some nervous habits that she has squelched but that come out when she is at true rest, in her inner sanctum -- she is naturally a jittery person but she knows that her stability is the Well's stability.  She eats the same thing day in and day out, by her own preference. She would like to go on long walks more but the regular pregnancy makes it hard. She loves sweets and would eat ice cream at every meal if they'd let her. 

One of her first children was Fi, who is now grown, or close to it. She is deeply empathic, but with plants instead of humans--an early misbreeding mistake.  She was quickly recognized as such and raised with the other children, aware of her connection to the Queen but also taught from an early age that she wasn't good enough and would have to live with the others.
