Finnelle Thorn.

Born 2738

Finnelle was taken by the Delvers at an early age, planned by the community because her parents both showed an unusual gift with plant life. She's a bit of a mutant and doesn't fit in well with the Delvers. 

Her last name is ceremonial, given by the Delvers to honor her specialty.  Since her parents had her as part of the breeding program, she isn't around them much.  

She has red hair, tan skin, and very light gray eyes. She is short.



She grew up in the Well and still goes there for any bigger ceremonies and things, but stays away for the most part.  She lives in a town near to Lo's, but they don't meet until the story starts.  

She's in love with one of the BA Delvers -- a sort of teenage crush that never really went away.  She struggles to move on from that relationship but is constantly pulled back in.
