# Delvers

All Facts and Open Questions about the Fungus

This society is relatively small and isolated, ruled by a class called the Delvers. 

## Culture

* The Delvers started out as an organization devoted to peace keeping, higher evolution of humans, enlightenment, and other good things.
* Humans are very responsible with their emotions, and have huge toolboxes for letting go of bad things and managing their emotional responses. 
* It's a society that values close relationships, that doens't define gender, that has a much lower human population than our current one. 
*   There are not many outside visitors though within a county-area you are welcome to travel among towns. 

## Abilities

* The Delvers are a mix of highly trained and naturally gifted--they are able to manipulate emotions with sound as well as by touch and sight.
* They are extremely sensitive to emotional states and can calm entire populations.  
* Some Delvers have particular gifts -- eg Fi has a connection with plants. 
* They achieved this level of skill through a combination of skill and because of a very rare and specific tree they use to make potions. 
* They use the potions both for themselves and also for calming the population around them. 
* The Delvers manage foreign relations with other communities in some way that keeps everyone safe but it's not clear how they do that to the people in the community.

## Open Questions

* Do the Delvers actually use potions? 

## Things I'm Pretty Sure Are Wrong

* The Delvers rule over our society, but they also send emissaries to recruit/kidnap children with natural skills to bring them into the fold. They have been doing this for generations so most of the group is unusually sensitive--they are just untrained, used for breeding stock.
