# Plan for editing

* ~~Read the whole dang thing~~
* Put it in sequential order-ish -- done on paper, not done digitally
* Identify gaps in the story that need to be written
* Identify weakly written scenes that need to be revised
* Rewrite bad scenes
* Write new scenes
* Go through each scene and improve it sentence by sentence.
  - Is verbs
  - Passive voice
* Find more strategies for revision and improvement. 
* Go blind from reading your book too much. 
* Get an editor to read it.
