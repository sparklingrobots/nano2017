# OVERVIEW

## Concept
Concept ~is a world without a strong sense of heroes~.

I'm still looking for my Die Hard level concept. 

## Theme
Sharing power (learning to take your power, learning to share power). (Unless it's liberation or just power.)

Every scene, every moment, must be on-theme. 

## Genre 
Might be time to read: Shawn Coyne Story Grid, because lord I have no idea what genres are. 

Current theory is like: a mystery? It's not a murder mystery, it's more...thriller-y, maybe? 

## The Inciting Incident

Harvest -- double murder of Delvers. 


### How is the climax embedded in the inciting incident? 

A) We learn more about the reason the powers are here and how they work.
B) It happens at the spring (as the climax does).
C) It involves the total destruction of good and bad delvers on a micro scale. 

### Some old notes I'm not sure what to do with 
The bad thing (whatever the bad thing is) must be brought into the culture, must be digested by it and transformed. 

Could the bad thing threaten the tree?  Be the tree? Be inside the tree? 

The tree had a spore in it that came loose when Fi psychically jostled it.  It infected mostly Delvers, who were vulnerable to the signals.  Those Delvers started to get stuck, resentful, isolated, and started turning people to their side. 

The song that Fi saw is indeed a containment spell that has been perverted/forgotten & rewritten by the Delvers in the area, but they don't remember any more where it came from.  So they sing it to the Well instead of the tree. 

The birds in the area know something of the tree.  They know that of the two lines of humans (Delvers & non) they will merge into one better species.  They know that Lo is the one to do it becuase they recognize her from her ancestor/reincarnated self, which is why they declare her King of All Birds. 

The Delvers want to broadcast their fucked up and vaguely fascist views longer distance. So they resurrect an old radio station and start pirate broadcasting.  This is where Lo breaks in at the end of the book and has to disable the device (in retrospect everything about that scene should be Su.  Su is more mechanical and will want to save Io but will not feel SO fucked up by it.)

In the mean time Lo has assembled her group to sing to the tree.  The singing will actually trigger a kind of collapse of the space/time continuum, so all the Protectors will be singing at the same time (why does this one trigger and no other time does?).  And when they do that, the tree will push out the antidote to the Bad Guys.  

But they don't solve it in time to save the Delvers.  And the Bad Guys have proven that this kind of secretive culture & structure is too dangerous.  So Lo knows her next phase in life is teaching the Delver skills to everyoe.  


# OUR HERO

## WHO'S THE HERO

Lo is a nobody, an unhappy loner on the edges of her friend group. She's an amateur musicologist/music historian who spends as much time as she can in the library--learning the old songs, absorbing the old mass media.  She wishes she had been made into a Delver and discovers partway through the book that the Delvers rejected her--but has no idea why. 

She's very dedicated to the communal life but has an itch she can't quite scratch. She knows she could be greater but struggles to understand the concept of a person being greater. 


Lo is the main character.  The world is a different place where we work together, where we've developed all kinds of ways of making things work with our bodies, with the earth.  Like in 17776, many problems have been solved. 

So the main problem is, perhaps, simply an emotional one.  In 17776, the main issue is that the old probe can't catch up to the new times.  The new painless times. The struggle for meaning in the face of absolutely no threat.

She is the guardian of a secret and the organizer of a team who needs to either find the secret or make it all work together.  



## WHAT ARE THE TWO CONFLICTING NEEDS OF THE PROTAGONIST

She desperately needs to protect the Delvers, but in following the mission they gave her, she discovers that her actions will unravel the Delvers.  

OR

She desperately needs to help the Delvers survive this threat, so her world stays intact. 
and she desperately needs to find out why she was rejected by them and to live out her place in the prophecy. 

## WHAT MAKES THE STAR THE STAR

Lo is uniquely gifted in her ability to synthesize melody and meaning--she's a song writer at heart, but the tight control of the Delvers over music mean she's not able to write and share her music publicly. (OOOOOOH THERE WE GO).  They know this, they know she could destroy them if she gets the training from them, so they reject her--but ultimately she's the one able to save everyone. 

She earns a strange title at some point: King of All Birds (but not that becuase that's a song title).

OKAY BUT: As established below, Lo is also a bit bookish and shy and not prone to Big Leadership Stuff.  She cries off to the side during singing practice.  She is always looking for answers outside of herself.   

// The thing that makes her a star is that she says no.  
// Faced with her loved one, turned dark, worming their way into her psyche, she says no. 

Lo does incredible things in service of the community, stretching and changing to fit what they need fromn her--and in the changing she changes too.  

Lo is a star because she's a super smart, semi-magical book worm.  She's just a person who is unaware of her great place in this world. She brings the Delvers to everyone--and if they had chosen her, they might have avoided that fate.  

## WHAT IS THE CROWBAR? 

In other words, what is the stuff that the villain speech preys upon? Right now she is so hermetic, so sealed off and ...

...maybe that is the thing!!! 

The thing is that her weakness is a preference for being alone, though she knows that's not a thing that they're all supposed to feel. She is supposed to forget the word alone but she desperately craves it. She craves isolation, not having to be part of the big web.  

We'll see.  But I think the big threat in some ways is the sustainability/adaptability of patriarchy and power structures that we have now.  And we sealed them up but we maybe fucked it up.  

UPDATE: the crowbar is not this.  She does feel those things but mostly the main crowbar is the question of why is she helping the people who rejected her?  Io knows Lo's long suffering from this early rejection and uses that knowledge against her to get her to leave the project, to give up. 

# BAD STUFF

## WHAT IS THE JEOPARDY

The Jeopardy is that the Delvers are flawed but better than the alternatives that are arising in other places. 

The jeopardy is her two conflicting needs.  She will be forced to choose.  Perhaps in her choosing she can outwit the villain and get them both--but in her heart she will know that she has to make a choice.  

(Flora 717's two needs were to survive, which entailed fitting in, and to be the unique and magical bee she knew she was.  She didn't get them--but she did get to survive in that weird parenting way.  And she definitely was the unique and magical bee.  In some ways her needs (though she didn't know them) (how interesting is that!?!?) were to save the hive and to destroy the hive.  And she saved the hive by destroying it.)

(Damn.)

That feels almost right for this story, but I'm writing visionary fiction and the world I'm drawing isn't one I want to destroy.  But the feeling of learning something horrifying and knowing that you must bring it to light despite great upheaval is very interesting to me. 

I also don't really love the "dark government" or "dark corporation" angles because I want a world without them--or with extremely weakened vestigial forms of them. 

Lo doesn't know her choice at first. Going into the Villain Speech, she thinks the choice is help the Delvers or don't.  Be generous to the Delvers or be selfish and bitter.  That's the crowbar Io uses against her and it very nearly works.  She has spent so long feeling left out and powerless, invisible to the people she wants to help most....Io is able to point out to her how good and special they made her feel and how they had denied that to her. Io doesn't even know about the whole rejected-as-an-infant thing but it supports things for Lo. 

But during the speech, she realizes that she doesn't care, that she is still interested in helping people.  And she somehow realizes that she will end up destroying the Delvers even as she helps them.  Maybe the actual specific song or the specific spell that they have to do just flat out ruins the Delvers.  Or maybe she realizes that having independent voices with a stronger independent mind behind each one will be better than the weird hive like behaviors of the Delvers. Maybe she needs to train lots of people to help her who aren't allowed to hear the Delvers' secrets. 

UGH should I just pick one or is it better to keep letting it unspool at its own speed? 

The puzzle will need to be surrounding the issue of the ethnobotany. Things that have crossed my mind: The forest scenes in Stranger Things (e.g. another universe touching ours), the Northern Reach trilogy (e.g. a menacing and inhuman threat)


## WHO'S THE VILLAIN

The villain is (no joke) (but lulz) a ghost or virus or meme or something like that, embedded inside of the very old tree. It is unleashed on our poor unsuspecting magic redhead (not Lo) who realizes the grave danger but cannot stop it herself.  

The idea gets out and starts infecting people. FUD spread.  Hatred and division grow. Our loyal true-hearted narrator is the only one who can counteract, though she is bookish and shy and not likely to give great speeches to the world.  

So the villain is perhaps a mindless terror, rather than a malicious person.  But we have to give somebody a really good villain speech.  A really good villain speech from somebody so close to Lo, who knows her weaknesses and knows what will make her want to turn to the dark side. 

The terror found the man with the coffee.

TODO: What is the relationship between the man with the coffee / the virus / the ancient cult / Io? 

## WHAT IS THE MONSTER?

Monsters in gardening include: 
* Animals that eat everything
* Poisons
* Drought
* Mold
* Bugs 
* Floods/natural disasters

Monsters in history include: 
* Mold
* Decay
* Loss
* Disruptive events that destroy records
* Disinterest
* Fallibility of memory
* Ghosts 

Mold is an obvious overlap here.  Mold as it grows from small spores, a treacherous threat that works, I suppose in much the way that this culture works--communally, collectively, piece by small piece, transforming into something good (to the mold). 

The Bad Guys are the actual avatar of the villain--regular humans who have become infected into this thing.  They named themselves ironically the Bad Guys, since gender has mostly disappeared and men in particular are infrequently represented. 

Here's what I'm thinking:  The glass tube they put in the tree is a mold, but it's a special magical mold.  And it breaks when Fi is delving.  It escapes out the original hole and spreads far and wide -- but the Delvers see it as a variety of visions.  There are Delvers who are infected at a certain radius from the tree (the way spores spread) and a bunch of non-delvers who start having disturbing fantasies--who are in turn preyed upon by the Bad Guys 

## HOW DO WE KEEP THE MONSTER FRONT AND CENTER IN ACT TWO?

Act two is going to be a lot of research and will need *soething* else to happen to not be terrible. 

I think *we* know that Io has turned but Lo does not.  So we see Io creeping around and "helping" Lo but we know that it's bad news. 

## WHAT ARE THE STAKES

The stakes are huge--the whole society. Not sure how yet. 

The Delvers are a group of kind and sensitive people that keep society stable--and they're in danger. It's up to one woman with a love of old song books to keep the Delvers on track, but as she learns more about her mission, she realizes the Delvers are in danger whether or not she succeeds.  It's up to her to decide the fate of the Delvers--and the fate of the world that relies on them. 

YAY BOOK JACKET BLURB! ^^

## WHAT IS THE VILLAIN SPEECH



## WHAT'S THE COUNTER THEME

This one is fascinating.  In a world like the one I envision, what is the counter theme? If the theme is something like: we can grow together into a stronger species, what is the opposite theme? What will be the ongoing struggle in the other direction? Or will there be a crisis? There has to be a crisis or this book will really be terrible. 


## WHAT'S THE CLIMAX

How do we have a gardening related climax? It sounds so boring and slow. Why did I do this to myself. 

Okay, I think it's a mold or invasive species that unlocks the baddy. 

The climax goes something like this:

Lo has the cure/the key.  She has the right song but they all have to sing it together.  She's trying to gather her people together and get them in the right place and right context. 

She goes to her most trusted person but they've turned.  They've gone bad and they want her to go with them.  She doesn't realize it at first then realizes that something is very very wrong.  She tries the song on them but it's not enough by herself.  They sing a counter melody and she feels herself falling.  She runs away.  She knows she needs to get the others and she still wants to get her bestie.  But her bestie isn't there anymore.  

And now the bestie knows waht's up and pursues them all, disrupting and flipping them as able. 

Finally Lo is able to reach the tree, has the robes, has the folks and together they sing, the mountains quiver and the buildings vanish and they are in a new place, they are the original ones who tried to cast this spell of protection and failed, the tree is flaming and they get it right this time. (We have to find the flaw in whatever it was before.)

They return to the present moment, much older and more tired.  

Lo has lost her bestie. She writes a new song of mourning for the loss, but a new song--with a solo. With some love song references. 


I want to write at length about what the climax is here. 

Lo has found some information that not everyone can access.  This information is very important and very dangerous.  I'm not sure yet if it's dangerous to Lo and her crew or if it's dangerous to an outside entity.  

Let's brainstorm about outside entities that could be harmful but are not human: 

No, wrong question. 

We already have these on-theme monsters: 

Monsters in gardening include: 
* Animals that eat everything
* Poisons
* Drought
* Mold
* Bugs 
* Floods/natural disasters
* People stealing or disrupting your harvest
* Invasive species 
* Catastrophic earth events (meteors, global warming)

Monsters in history include: 
* Mold
* Decay
* Loss
* Disruptive events that destroy records
* Disinterest
* Fallibility of memory
* War 
* Illiteracy

A list of ideas: 
* The Great Mourning caused us to revert to illiteracy from a belief that spoken word cultures were more sustainable
* The patriarchy is hidden in the tree. (lulz at that sentence but let's roll with it). Some kind of pattern or habit or something is exposed in the vision of the tree and it unleashes some of our bad patterns back on us (thinking here of the "sustainability of patriarchy" from Cynthia Enloe)
* People are just different from each other and this utopia is bound to have dissenters. I just don't want to present a visionary future that is the kind of utopia you can't help but destroy (which is what i'm experiencing right now).  
* * How do they do it on Star Trek? That's a visionary society.  Everybody in the Federation is committed wholeheartedly to the ideals of the Federation--but the ideals are difficult to uphold and there are external enemies who don't care at all/maybe even hate the Federation. 

Okay so maybe the idea is that humanity has come together.  

Then a threat from somewhere else appears--could be an alien, could be a weird apparition from the past (I THINK WE KNOW WHICH ONE IS A WINNER) but it does NOT like what is going on and wants to push us into a different habit.  Some people fall prey to it, others resist strongly. 

OKAY I AM LIKING THIS. 




## WHAT'S THE CONCEPT

together = better

It's like Cloud Atlas but for raging feminists who hate cars. 

It's like a time travelling Snow Crash. 

TODO: Develop the concept. 

## HOW DO THE CHARACTERS REPRESENT THAT CONCEPT?

TODO: How do the characters represent that concept? 

## WHAT'S THE GENRE

I'm thinking like... a visionary mystery novel.  An informational mystery novel. 

Unsurprisingly Snow Crash continue to point the way but I can't put my finger on how.  

IT'S A THRILLER!! DUH.  This is always what I write (that's a lie) but it's totally a thriller. I love reading thrillers but they're all full of ridiculous men and women treated like trash.  I want a thriller that can happen in a world I want to live in and FOR FUCK'S SAKE I want a thriller with a feminine/female/nb protagonist, this shit shouldn't be that hard and NOBODY GETS TO FUCKING SWOOP IN AND SAVE HER. 

## WHAT'S THE THEME

The theme has something to do with: 

History and how we care for it

The Great Mourning is a period of loss and letting prized things/beings/experiences slip into the past gracefully. Then understanding that things will die and we are here to help the dead decay and feed the living. 

We let the GM fix a lot of things about our eocological problems.  We are still, however, a species with conflict and desire and ambition.   

# The theme is death, maybe.  History & gardening.  

There is also a strong musical component because like obviously. I'm sure there's a novel that I'm biting this whole singing-to-the-plants thing from but I can't name it at present. 

## WHAT IS THE SETTING 

North American city in ruins? Deciduous foresty place.  Highways are gone. 

## RANDOM THOUGHTS

"Rosa Luxemburg said the revolution would be a spiritual transformation and Adrienne traces that out beautifully in her post." Femme Too Deep podcast.  Some people want to behave and some people want to get free. They're all surviving. -adrienne maree brown

What it is for someone to love someone(s) they know are bad for them.  Choosing individuality over a group that insists on the primacy of the group.
