I want to document my process for editing a novel, because I've never done it before and will likely forget the details over the MONTHS OR YEARS ~~OF SUFFERING~~ of work I'm undertaking. 

# 2017.11.01-2017.11.30
Writing the novel in one big intense go as part of NaNoWriMo.

# 2018.07.12
Re-read the novel at a writing retreat. Highlighted bits and tried to allocate to beginning/middle/end. 
Cut the draft into pieces, and created index cards for each "scene".

# 2018.11.01
Started trying to edit. Can't find my super helpful cut-up draft, but did find index cards. 

# 2018.11.02
Going through files and moving them into their proper location--though I got stuck on the first one which is barely a scene and more of a passing thought. Started rewriting it and need to find the narrative hook that will make this into something worth reading. 
Also need to sort out how I will name my chunks of text, and if I need to/want to retain the index cards. Either in their own format or maybe on github as cards there. Hmmm.
Ooh! I just dug up the paper copy that got all taped together back in July. Let's see if this still makes any sense to me....
Decided I would use #todo to mark things that need work directly in the text so I can just grep for them later.

# 2018.11.03
I'm starting to feel where there needs to be more writing -- things need to be contextualized. Like maybe I can start to see how one begins to shape a chapter--but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I wrote some new stuff--feeling all filled up by this beautiful fall atmosphere I've missed so many years here. Also just feeling weird about this project and self-conscious and...I don't know. 
Sorting through my mind for something to do: I first turn to Revising Prose but am stymied by an example he claims is simple. I then google "How to outline", feeling that things might go easier if I had an outline of *some sort* instead of *no sort*.  I find an interesting "snowflake method" that feels related to what I am doing--sketching out the barest outlines and then filling it into something more like a novel. (Admittedly he says to do that part first and THEN write the novel.). I've now written several single sentences a la NYT Bestsellers List and they're all too long and also kind of bad. Partially the book is just tough to summarize. Reading a review of the Witch Elm makes me feel...I dunno, jealous? They all seem so great...straightforward 8 word summary, massively awesome book. I CAN DO THIS BUT IT *IS* HARD.
I started working on some of the Great Mourning stuff, thinking I can reshape it into a history written by the Delvers, which I love...we start with trusting that but then change to seeing it in a bad light as Lo does.  I just really need to sort out the shape of this story, to stop just sketching the situations and shying away from the details.  But, we'll get there. Fractal snowflakes. 

# 2018.11.04
Got a later start than I wanted this morning, but really enjoying the process so far. Last night Paul suggested I just write out the plot as I know it, which I did today and it is starting to feel manageable. Probably great swaths of things will be removed. I need to figure out what exactly make the Delvers bad and what exactly motivates the Bad Guys. I think I have an interesting story and I don't think that masculinity can be the only evil.  
Trying to just be patient and to keep reading--I may have solved some of these issues already (like what's the actual bad stuff??) and am overdoing the work. So trying to at least read each scene as I cut it up and to summarize it. Then adding the summary to a card on the GitHub project to try to get that all out in the open. 
I think this may be a five-act structure so I am gonna need some learning on how to do that. Act 1: Meet characters. Act 2: Meet Delvers. Act 3: Lo strugles to sort out secret. Act 4: Lo finds the Delvers have fucked with her, Act 5: Lo blows it all to hell. 
Realizing that in some ways obsessively organizing is helping me get there, helping me cut this into pieces small enough to handle. So I'm going through and renaming scenes semantically/descriptively, and making sure all files are CamelCase. Starting to see some scenes are already in the wrong spots. Also updating GitHub cards with both the summary and the file name.

# 2018.11.05
I'm proud of myself for stopping Norsemen even though NO ONE ELSE wanted to. 
I'm starting to feel like maybe the tree is a red herring or ...I don't know. It might need to be something else.  The story right now has a lot more to do with human foibles and I'm not sure at all what will make the tree into something reasonable/logical. 
Got through the middle section of the papers. A lot of it is just condensing things into files they belong in.  I'm starting to get a sense for parts of the story that are either insufficiently coupled with the themes or just plain random/bad. I start to feel a bit that I'm not quite following the story I set out to write, but I'm hoping I can get there. Hoping I can paint an amazing society with lots of cool elements that also gets disrupted by something even cooler. Things I value: equality, environmental concern, close knit communities, lack of genders. Creativity can be disruptive, individuality can be disruptive. I also want the villain to be really good, to make *sense* why they're destroying this awesome thing, to be a bit sympathetic even. 
The outline is getting a little wild and wooly but I think it's okay. I still need to pick a single sentence, but I'm not quite sure yet what the story is! 
Also did some slight clean-up as I went, removing some "a bit" and "just" and "is" boring words. Still need to work out who kicks who. What's the driving force from one scene to the next. I suck at this but I'm getting better every day.

# 2018.11.06 
There's a lot here, and I'm still wafflign on some of the biggest decisions -- what is actually the climax? What's actually happening here? Sometimes I hit on a solution that feels VERY RIGHT but I'm hesitant to commit because what if I have to throw everything else out?  I think the answer is to keep working, to keep smoothing off the rough edges. Many of these scenes are terrible anyway, so if I DO throw them out, what's the loss? 
Am I stuck too much in outlining level? I can't decide if I should sink down into the scenes or stay at the 10,000 foot view.

# 2018.11.08
Yesterday I read some Pressfield and worked a bit on the plane--mostly thinking. Today I snuck a little chunk of time to work some of the rough edges off--to formalize how to make this into Hero's Journey, and got some exciting ideas. Lo stays at the Well, for example, and is driven off by Bad Delvers. 
I'm now stuck on a whole thing with the tree--how do the Delvers get their power, what's the relevance of the harvest, etc. We'll get there but ugh big questions all around. 

# 2018.11.09
Well, the blessing of a delayed flight is more time to write in the (relatively) comfortable gate area instead of on the tiny airplane seat.  
Today I'm writing what I feel is the first scene of the book. It's all starting to feel a touch cliched (like I've read this scene before, because I have, in Harry Potter during that one Quidditch scene) but it's also starting to feel good. Like, a lot of times I realize now, I start a new paragraph because I've run out of steam.  I am beginning to realize that, in fact, there may be such a thing as a thesis statement even in fiction, that each paragraph has a certain logic/scope to it that isn't random. I keep putting the thesis statement at the end of the previous paragraph. 
What exactly did I THINK paragraphs did in fiction? I feel now I have been reading so ignorantly, assuming talent/nature/instinct would guide me when in fa t it, like all things, is artifice and needs my help. 
Goddam I am tired and totally unable to focus. But I've written (or started writing) the other side of the murder. It's unlikely I'll need both...BUT I do need to know how it all goes down and I need to figure out more about what's going on. Is it a poison in the water? Is the bubbleweed ruined? Or is it something else altogether? Whatever it is, I think it needs to be solved with song--although. Although I think then the intiating incident needs something to mirror the singing. Or it needs something to mirror the communal effort that is our final scene. 

# 2018.11.14
SD HistCon, as usual, proved a detriment to my writing life.  But I didn't ruin myself.  I did drink too much on Sunday night and then slept a ton Monday. Tuesday I also didn't feel good so slept that day--hence not getting back to it for almost 5 days. Still, here I am, and well, it went okay.  I've started trying to organize things slowly.  Numbered a bunch of sections now that I've broken it into first, second and third acts--so I am starting to have something that might look like a legible draft if not for the bus-sized plot holes. 
I can't tell if the Pressfield book is actually helpful or not. It feels like it gives me some structure to aim for, but also I feel like crap when I can't write something insanely brilliant. Like, yes, every moment of the Godfather IS intentional and on-theme.  I'm not sure I'm there yet (let's be frank, I'm sure I'm NOT there yet).  So, part of me thinks maybe it just makes my standards too high. And part of me thinks that it's too vague as it is, that there is ever more to learn and study. And there is. 
The closer I get to writing the way I want to, the farther I feel. It's exhausting. 
Realizing also that I'm about 50% of the way through the month and less than 25% of the way to my reduced goals. But...once I get started on things I tend to pick up speed, I think. So let's hope tomorrow morning I can get up very early and write for at least an hour. 

# 2018.11.15
This morning I realized I wish I had been posting blogs as I went.  Maybe I still will--I'm "halfway" done but nowhere near the finish line. 
Today I'm actually re-writing a scene instead of just moving things around and feeling overwhelmed.  So that feels good.  Things are starting to feel coherent and I notice a pattern--if I stay with it for too long in any given session, I get demoralized.  But the beginning of a sesssion usually feels pretty good.  My mind is fresh and not tired with wondering what all is going to happen. 
I did blog about it! That felt good. As soon as it was done I realized I maybe should be sending to my newsletter instead, but that felt...not right. So I didn't. I'd rather burn those decision cycles on the book than on the details of the sharing. So I shared and moved on. 
Two things: I looked up the 3 act breakdown of Hero's Journey and feel glad that I correctly intuited where the breaks are. Also, I am simplifying the number of characters.  And will need to find a specific model for Lo so she can be a real person.

# 2018.11.16
I got up super early after going to bed super early. I've been up for a little over an hour--ate breakfast, hung out with dad, worked out, showered--and still have two hours left to write. Lights out at 9 am is AWESOME.
I felt super excited about having a chapter break..but the chapter is thus far only 770 words which is ... pretty dang short for a chapter. I will not begrudge Faulkner his "mother is a fish" chapter but a) I'm not yet Faulkner and b) 770 words is no "my mother is a fish". 
So, today was really hard. Did not feel good about pretty much anything, including my body (lots of stomach pain).  I read some of Revising Prose which I'm not sure will be that helpful as I'm not much of an academic writer these days.  I also fell down a rabbithole on TVTropes, which was helpful and also a distraction. I'm relieved to hear that others have done some of what I am trying to do--and also self-conscious about tropes.  But I (sorta) forced myself to sit down and really look at what the plot actually is so I'm not just writing weird scenes over and over again that are Lovecraftian in their vagueness. I like some of the twists that came up and am looking forward to figuring it all out. And also looking forward to writing most of the middle of the book. :D

# 2018.11.17
This morning I feel compelled to flesh out Lo and Fi a bit more--make them into real people so I can write the middle of the book at long last. I have tried this kind of exercise before, filling out little sheets with factoids about the characters, but I never really *find* them that way.  I just have some weird ragged puppet to push around. I feel myself pushing up against the limits of my weaknesses--I don't like to think about what drives other people; I like to let them take care of themselves. Well, time for some personal growth, y'all! It's a cold Saturday and I'm doing laundry, so why tf not?

It somehow feels satisfying to nail certain things down. I know the year now! I don't know what difference it makes, and it might change, but it feels good. Fi is younger than Lo. 

# 2018.11.18
Wrote on the plane. My inability to look things up, Google impulsively, etc maybe led to writing a new and important scene. Developed a new character from it too... Writing by hand had a certain quality to it, don't know if that's why the session went so well, but it's interesting to imagine. Might try more sessions by hand when I don't have a need to edit something existing.

# 2018.11.20
I need to find new ways to talk about emotions other than "washed over" and "filled".  Time to read some good books closely. 
I wrote yesterday as well--as much as I wish I could get in 2 hours a day, 20 minutes is about what I've managed (even today on y writing day T_T).  I typed up the stuff from the airplane--now that I'm distant from it all the flaws are clear--how do I make this into the big revelatory scene it needs to be?? But some of that relies on the right build-up which I certainly don't have yet.  And I'll just keep re-writing it.  I like the bones of the thing.  I like the queen and I like the test and the knife edge of the moment.  
I'm beginning to know that there's no way I am going to make it even to 40 this month. Maybe it's time to drop the goal again--but the goal also feels so good.  Still, when will I have the time to work on it?  Thanksgiving through to the end of the month all seems a bit unlikely.  But if I could get 20 minutes every single day, during this busy time...that would feel pretty awesome.  That would put me at about 22 hours.  I wonder if...I don't know. I could write on the train to and from work. It feels pretty sad compared to 50, but that's unfair given that I've said NO to 50 hours already. The fact is I've worked almost every day this month! DAMN. No wonder I'm learning at light speed. 

# 2018.11.22 
Today is thanksgiving and yesterday was travel for thanksgiving. I've been focusing on 

#2018.11.23 
Yesterday I thought I'd have some time to at least write notes. I obviously did not.  There's been lots and lots of family time. I've been making an extreme effort to get enough sleep after getting a little snappish with Evan the first night we were here.  Now I'm noveling.  Holidays are tough for this.  I think....Stephen King wrote 3000 words every day no matter what. A) I don't think I'm that kind of novelist, e.g. when did he have the time to FIX what was wrong with the existing stuff? and B) I am still inspired by it.  His family knew that he would be writing first thing. Always. It was a feature of life.  What do I need to get something like that in my life? I think slowly I'm building it with my workouts and my writing times. Slowly but surely (and painfully) reminding myself and my family that these things matter to me. That I don't do things before I get to those times. Did/does Stephen King travel? Does the 3k rule hold there? I have a wonderful amount of time to write as it is, she says, pollyanna-ishly, but I am excited for the future when perhaps I have even more. 

# 2018.11.25
I am taking some time out of our busy social schedule to get an hour or so of writing done.  It's great. It feels a bit selfish but I also feel satisfied in a way I haven't in several days (she says before she gets down to actual writing). Yesterday I started reading that Beating the Story book--it feels perhaps a bit more of the same (re: nobody wants to write your shit) but I am trying to think of it as just undertaking the work I've needed to do for a long time--to understand the ways stories actually work so I can write them. 
I've found myself thinking of future interviews, which is a weird and probably unhealthy thing, but I think has something to do with how much I've had the opportunity to talk about dance making. And to talk about it and why/how I've taken the path I have. The old novelist who had zero story telling skills, who finally settled into narrative at 35.  The writer with no story telling skills.  You know. (I don't know.) I feel so completely unskilled at everything but that's not fair. I've wanted to write because I've admired writers so much. 
Also, the process of writing a novel has revealed one sort of strange thing. The thing that I love so much is writing practice--being surprised by my own mind--and working something into a novel is almost the opposite. I have to write to a specific end. Still I try to find space to be surprised as much as I can be, to let the story tell itself and to guide me. Trying not to force it too much while still being intentional and correct in the building of the thing. Whatever that means. 
Last night at Choreographers' Evening I thought a lot about what it is to be visionary rather than reactionary. Realizing my dance making was heavily reactionary though I think the result may have been more visionary.  Two particular novel thoughts came up: 1) maybe the song itself is a character? Or a viewpoint? 2) Maybe each song has a poetic/kinetic interlude in the text--not necessarily the lyrics themselves but some kind of spirit that gets a page or two after each song (like Hemingway's bull fighting interludes, kind of?). Anyway it's all thoughts for now. 
God above, I am so tired, like wanting to sleep right here in the Starbucks. That's my getting 7 hrs of sleep last night, I guess. :( I hate when I get tired while writing, feels lke a type of resistance that I don't know how to get around. I suppose if I were to go and actually sleep when I feel tired, I probably wouldn't get tired.  
The plot holes are freaking me out and not sure how to resolve or where to focus my efforts.  I'm realizing many of my descriptive scenes can be much longer than they currently are. I used to elaborate too much on parts of the scene that don't matter (saying hello) and when I cut that down, I think I also reduced the amount of description I used. 
I AM getting better, or at least more knowledgeable. My instincts are starting to feel like they are more than just blind fumblings. But LORD this is a lot of work. 
One thing I am beginning to realize: Probably when I'm like "WAIT HOW DOES THIS PLOT WORK" it may be worth just writing the scene a few different ways and seeing which one fits best. That seems so exhausting but it may be more reasonable than committing whole hog to whatever nonsense comes out of the pen first. 

# DECEMBER

## 2018.12.03
Okay, well, I haven't been here in 8 days. I've thought about the book a fair amount but not enough to stay in the world. I'm reading Emergent Strategy which is helping me remember the brain space I was in last year while writing. 
I'm really writing this as a warm up to actually getting to work. Plan is to do 15 hours in December. A hair less than November but it feels sustainable. 
Today I spent only 12 minutes, but I needed to get oriented before my big session tomorrow. And I feel I've done it! The answer is: Open files until one of them tells you how to work on it. (I also looked on github to see what I haven't touched in a while. Very handy.)

## 2018.12.09
Turns out I had bronchitis so I have been mostly focused on sleeping and caring for my body. Hard to want to sit and write with a splitting sinus headache and violent cough. I'm still feeling shaky and frankly very tired. I also am scared of the novel now, having been away so long, and don't really want to jump in.  But today is a writing retreat day and dammit I'm gonna get into the swing of things. I think the daily engagement during early November was really crucial to keeping up momentum--even if I can only get like 15 minutes in I think touching the material every day would be a big help. Anyway, enough putting off the inevitable, time to dive into a scene. 
I've spent a fair amount of time today just moving things around. It feels both finicky & pretty relevant. I need to be able to dip back in more easily and the three thousand versions of the plot that are floating around really don't help. I need *one* that's canonical. I'm clearly not the writer who can hold this all in my head at once.  
I find I have something inside me that says: Yes, this is the right way. No, that's the wrong way. It's not honestly a great weathervane at this point--it pulls me in too many directions, doesn't thread the needle quite.  But I have it. It's in there. And that's a great relief. 
Just re-arranged my day as I'm starting to feel some novel momentum of some small amount--not time to switch gears, methinks. 
Okay, got 2 hours in. I want to touch this much more frequently--daily if possible until it's done. 

## 2018.12.10
Writing at the end of a long day, but it feels good to have my hands on it. Lots of interruptions from family members just wanting to catch up, but I felt okay about it for the most part. Tomorrow morning it's time to get up early and do so much!! What I will do I don't know, but DO IT I SHALL.

## 2018.12.11
Reading Witch Elm last night and feeling gobsmacked by dialogue. Also by the first person. So today I will try both. 
Another thing I'd like to try is establishing the Delvers as good earlier--Paul's read of them was sinister only so I need to anchor them early on as good. 
I still avoided any dialogue at all! But an opening scene is developing. I think I like it if it's not too ham-handed.  God, this is going to take the rest of my life to finish. 

## 2018.12.12
All day I've been feeling excited about getting to work tonight, and while my thoughts aren't deeply in the novel, the fact that they're there at all--and that they're positive!-- feels like a big win and confirmation of my daily-touches theory of noveling.
