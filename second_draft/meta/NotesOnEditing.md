I want to document my process for editing a novel, because I've never done it before and will likely forget the details over the MONTHS OR YEARS ~~OF SUFFERING~~ of work I'm undertaking. 

# 2017.11.01-2017.11.30
Writing the novel in one big intense go as part of NaNoWriMo.

# 2018.07.12
Re-read the novel at a writing retreat. Highlighted bits and tried to allocate to beginning/middle/end. 
Cut the draft into pieces, and created index cards for each "scene".

# November 2018

## 2018.11.01
Started trying to edit. Can't find my super helpful cut-up draft, but did find index cards. 

## 2018.11.02
Going through files and moving them into their proper location--though I got stuck on the first one which is barely a scene and more of a passing thought. Started rewriting it and need to find the narrative hook that will make this into something worth reading. 
Also need to sort out how I will name my chunks of text, and if I need to/want to retain the index cards. Either in their own format or maybe on github as cards there. Hmmm.
Ooh! I just dug up the paper copy that got all taped together back in July. Let's see if this still makes any sense to me....
Decided I would use #todo to mark things that need work directly in the text so I can just grep for them later.

## 2018.11.03
I'm starting to feel where there needs to be more writing -- things need to be contextualized. Like maybe I can start to see how one begins to shape a chapter--but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I wrote some new stuff--feeling all filled up by this beautiful fall atmosphere I've missed so many years here. Also just feeling weird about this project and self-conscious and...I don't know. 
Sorting through my mind for something to do: I first turn to Revising Prose but am stymied by an example he claims is simple. I then google "How to outline", feeling that things might go easier if I had an outline of *some sort* instead of *no sort*.  I find an interesting "snowflake method" that feels related to what I am doing--sketching out the barest outlines and then filling it into something more like a novel. (Admittedly he says to do that part first and THEN write the novel.). I've now written several single sentences a la NYT Bestsellers List and they're all too long and also kind of bad. Partially the book is just tough to summarize. Reading a review of the Witch Elm makes me feel...I dunno, jealous? They all seem so great...straightforward 8 word summary, massively awesome book. I CAN DO THIS BUT IT *IS* HARD.
I started working on some of the Great Mourning stuff, thinking I can reshape it into a history written by the Delvers, which I love...we start with trusting that but then change to seeing it in a bad light as Lo does.  I just really need to sort out the shape of this story, to stop just sketching the situations and shying away from the details.  But, we'll get there. Fractal snowflakes. 

## 2018.11.04
Got a later start than I wanted this morning, but really enjoying the process so far. Last night Paul suggested I just write out the plot as I know it, which I did today and it is starting to feel manageable. Probably great swaths of things will be removed. I need to figure out what exactly make the Delvers bad and what exactly motivates the Bad Guys. I think I have an interesting story and I don't think that masculinity can be the only evil.  
Trying to just be patient and to keep reading--I may have solved some of these issues already (like what's the actual bad stuff??) and am overdoing the work. So trying to at least read each scene as I cut it up and to summarize it. Then adding the summary to a card on the GitHub project to try to get that all out in the open. 
I think this may be a five-act structure so I am gonna need some learning on how to do that. Act 1: Meet characters. Act 2: Meet Delvers. Act 3: Lo strugles to sort out secret. Act 4: Lo finds the Delvers have fucked with her, Act 5: Lo blows it all to hell. 
Realizing that in some ways obsessively organizing is helping me get there, helping me cut this into pieces small enough to handle. So I'm going through and renaming scenes semantically/descriptively, and making sure all files are CamelCase. Starting to see some scenes are already in the wrong spots. Also updating GitHub cards with both the summary and the file name.

## 2018.11.05
I'm proud of myself for stopping Norsemen even though NO ONE ELSE wanted to. 
I'm starting to feel like maybe the tree is a red herring or ...I don't know. It might need to be something else.  The story right now has a lot more to do with human foibles and I'm not sure at all what will make the tree into something reasonable/logical. 
Got through the middle section of the papers. A lot of it is just condensing things into files they belong in.  I'm starting to get a sense for parts of the story that are either insufficiently coupled with the themes or just plain random/bad. I start to feel a bit that I'm not quite following the story I set out to write, but I'm hoping I can get there. Hoping I can paint an amazing society with lots of cool elements that also gets disrupted by something even cooler. Things I value: equality, environmental concern, close knit communities, lack of genders. Creativity can be disruptive, individuality can be disruptive. I also want the villain to be really good, to make *sense* why they're destroying this awesome thing, to be a bit sympathetic even. 
The outline is getting a little wild and wooly but I think it's okay. I still need to pick a single sentence, but I'm not quite sure yet what the story is! 
Also did some slight clean-up as I went, removing some "a bit" and "just" and "is" boring words. Still need to work out who kicks who. What's the driving force from one scene to the next. I suck at this but I'm getting better every day.

## 2018.11.06 
There's a lot here, and I'm still wafflign on some of the biggest decisions -- what is actually the climax? What's actually happening here? Sometimes I hit on a solution that feels VERY RIGHT but I'm hesitant to commit because what if I have to throw everything else out?  I think the answer is to keep working, to keep smoothing off the rough edges. Many of these scenes are terrible anyway, so if I DO throw them out, what's the loss? 
Am I stuck too much in outlining level? I can't decide if I should sink down into the scenes or stay at the 10,000 foot view.

## 2018.11.08
Yesterday I read some Pressfield and worked a bit on the plane--mostly thinking. Today I snuck a little chunk of time to work some of the rough edges off--to formalize how to make this into Hero's Journey, and got some exciting ideas. Lo stays at the Well, for example, and is driven off by Bad Delvers. 
I'm now stuck on a whole thing with the tree--how do the Delvers get their power, what's the relevance of the harvest, etc. We'll get there but ugh big questions all around. 

## 2018.11.09
Well, the blessing of a delayed flight is more time to write in the (relatively) comfortable gate area instead of on the tiny airplane seat.  
Today I'm writing what I feel is the first scene of the book. It's all starting to feel a touch cliched (like I've read this scene before, because I have, in Harry Potter during that one Quidditch scene) but it's also starting to feel good. Like, a lot of times I realize now, I start a new paragraph because I've run out of steam.  I am beginning to realize that, in fact, there may be such a thing as a thesis statement even in fiction, that each paragraph has a certain logic/scope to it that isn't random. I keep putting the thesis statement at the end of the previous paragraph. 
What exactly did I THINK paragraphs did in fiction? I feel now I have been reading so ignorantly, assuming talent/nature/instinct would guide me when in fa t it, like all things, is artifice and needs my help. 
Goddam I am tired and totally unable to focus. But I've written (or started writing) the other side of the murder. It's unlikely I'll need both...BUT I do need to know how it all goes down and I need to figure out more about what's going on. Is it a poison in the water? Is the bubbleweed ruined? Or is it something else altogether? Whatever it is, I think it needs to be solved with song--although. Although I think then the intiating incident needs something to mirror the singing. Or it needs something to mirror the communal effort that is our final scene. 

## 2018.11.14
SD HistCon, as usual, proved a detriment to my writing life.  But I didn't ruin myself.  I did drink too much on Sunday night and then slept a ton Monday. Tuesday I also didn't feel good so slept that day--hence not getting back to it for almost 5 days. Still, here I am, and well, it went okay.  I've started trying to organize things slowly.  Numbered a bunch of sections now that I've broken it into first, second and third acts--so I am starting to have something that might look like a legible draft if not for the bus-sized plot holes. 
I can't tell if the Pressfield book is actually helpful or not. It feels like it gives me some structure to aim for, but also I feel like crap when I can't write something insanely brilliant. Like, yes, every moment of the Godfather IS intentional and on-theme.  I'm not sure I'm there yet (let's be frank, I'm sure I'm NOT there yet).  So, part of me thinks maybe it just makes my standards too high. And part of me thinks that it's too vague as it is, that there is ever more to learn and study. And there is. 
The closer I get to writing the way I want to, the farther I feel. It's exhausting. 
Realizing also that I'm about 50% of the way through the month and less than 25% of the way to my reduced goals. But...once I get started on things I tend to pick up speed, I think. So let's hope tomorrow morning I can get up very early and write for at least an hour. 

## 2018.11.15
This morning I realized I wish I had been posting blogs as I went.  Maybe I still will--I'm "halfway" done but nowhere near the finish line. 
Today I'm actually re-writing a scene instead of just moving things around and feeling overwhelmed.  So that feels good.  Things are starting to feel coherent and I notice a pattern--if I stay with it for too long in any given session, I get demoralized.  But the beginning of a sesssion usually feels pretty good.  My mind is fresh and not tired with wondering what all is going to happen. 
I did blog about it! That felt good. As soon as it was done I realized I maybe should be sending to my newsletter instead, but that felt...not right. So I didn't. I'd rather burn those decision cycles on the book than on the details of the sharing. So I shared and moved on. 
Two things: I looked up the 3 act breakdown of Hero's Journey and feel glad that I correctly intuited where the breaks are. Also, I am simplifying the number of characters.  And will need to find a specific model for Lo so she can be a real person.

## 2018.11.16
I got up super early after going to bed super early. I've been up for a little over an hour--ate breakfast, hung out with dad, worked out, showered--and still have two hours left to write. Lights out at 9 am is AWESOME.
I felt super excited about having a chapter break..but the chapter is thus far only 770 words which is ... pretty dang short for a chapter. I will not begrudge Faulkner his "mother is a fish" chapter but a) I'm not yet Faulkner and b) 770 words is no "my mother is a fish". 
So, today was really hard. Did not feel good about pretty much anything, including my body (lots of stomach pain).  I read some of Revising Prose which I'm not sure will be that helpful as I'm not much of an academic writer these days.  I also fell down a rabbithole on TVTropes, which was helpful and also a distraction. I'm relieved to hear that others have done some of what I am trying to do--and also self-conscious about tropes.  But I (sorta) forced myself to sit down and really look at what the plot actually is so I'm not just writing weird scenes over and over again that are Lovecraftian in their vagueness. I like some of the twists that came up and am looking forward to figuring it all out. And also looking forward to writing most of the middle of the book. :D

## 2018.11.17
This morning I feel compelled to flesh out Lo and Fi a bit more--make them into real people so I can write the middle of the book at long last. I have tried this kind of exercise before, filling out little sheets with factoids about the characters, but I never really *find* them that way.  I just have some weird ragged puppet to push around. I feel myself pushing up against the limits of my weaknesses--I don't like to think about what drives other people; I like to let them take care of themselves. Well, time for some personal growth, y'all! It's a cold Saturday and I'm doing laundry, so why tf not?

It somehow feels satisfying to nail certain things down. I know the year now! I don't know what difference it makes, and it might change, but it feels good. Fi is younger than Lo. 

## 2018.11.18
Wrote on the plane. My inability to look things up, Google impulsively, etc maybe led to writing a new and important scene. Developed a new character from it too... Writing by hand had a certain quality to it, don't know if that's why the session went so well, but it's interesting to imagine. Might try more sessions by hand when I don't have a need to edit something existing.

## 2018.11.20
I need to find new ways to talk about emotions other than "washed over" and "filled".  Time to read some good books closely. 
I wrote yesterday as well--as much as I wish I could get in 2 hours a day, 20 minutes is about what I've managed (even today on y writing day T_T).  I typed up the stuff from the airplane--now that I'm distant from it all the flaws are clear--how do I make this into the big revelatory scene it needs to be?? But some of that relies on the right build-up which I certainly don't have yet.  And I'll just keep re-writing it.  I like the bones of the thing.  I like the queen and I like the test and the knife edge of the moment.  
I'm beginning to know that there's no way I am going to make it even to 40 this month. Maybe it's time to drop the goal again--but the goal also feels so good.  Still, when will I have the time to work on it?  Thanksgiving through to the end of the month all seems a bit unlikely.  But if I could get 20 minutes every single day, during this busy time...that would feel pretty awesome.  That would put me at about 22 hours.  I wonder if...I don't know. I could write on the train to and from work. It feels pretty sad compared to 50, but that's unfair given that I've said NO to 50 hours already. The fact is I've worked almost every day this month! DAMN. No wonder I'm learning at light speed. 

## 2018.11.22 
Today is thanksgiving and yesterday was travel for thanksgiving. I've been focusing on 

## 2018.11.23 
Yesterday I thought I'd have some time to at least write notes. I obviously did not.  There's been lots and lots of family time. I've been making an extreme effort to get enough sleep after getting a little snappish with Evan the first night we were here.  Now I'm noveling.  Holidays are tough for this.  I think....Stephen King wrote 3000 words every day no matter what. A) I don't think I'm that kind of novelist, e.g. when did he have the time to FIX what was wrong with the existing stuff? and B) I am still inspired by it.  His family knew that he would be writing first thing. Always. It was a feature of life.  What do I need to get something like that in my life? I think slowly I'm building it with my workouts and my writing times. Slowly but surely (and painfully) reminding myself and my family that these things matter to me. That I don't do things before I get to those times. Did/does Stephen King travel? Does the 3k rule hold there? I have a wonderful amount of time to write as it is, she says, pollyanna-ishly, but I am excited for the future when perhaps I have even more. 

## 2018.11.25
I am taking some time out of our busy social schedule to get an hour or so of writing done.  It's great. It feels a bit selfish but I also feel satisfied in a way I haven't in several days (she says before she gets down to actual writing). Yesterday I started reading that Beating the Story book--it feels perhaps a bit more of the same (re: nobody wants to write your shit) but I am trying to think of it as just undertaking the work I've needed to do for a long time--to understand the ways stories actually work so I can write them. 
I've found myself thinking of future interviews, which is a weird and probably unhealthy thing, but I think has something to do with how much I've had the opportunity to talk about dance making. And to talk about it and why/how I've taken the path I have. The old novelist who had zero story telling skills, who finally settled into narrative at 35.  The writer with no story telling skills.  You know. (I don't know.) I feel so completely unskilled at everything but that's not fair. I've wanted to write because I've admired writers so much. 
Also, the process of writing a novel has revealed one sort of strange thing. The thing that I love so much is writing practice--being surprised by my own mind--and working something into a novel is almost the opposite. I have to write to a specific end. Still I try to find space to be surprised as much as I can be, to let the story tell itself and to guide me. Trying not to force it too much while still being intentional and correct in the building of the thing. Whatever that means. 
Last night at Choreographers' Evening I thought a lot about what it is to be visionary rather than reactionary. Realizing my dance making was heavily reactionary though I think the result may have been more visionary.  Two particular novel thoughts came up: 1) maybe the song itself is a character? Or a viewpoint? 2) Maybe each song has a poetic/kinetic interlude in the text--not necessarily the lyrics themselves but some kind of spirit that gets a page or two after each song (like Hemingway's bull fighting interludes, kind of?). Anyway it's all thoughts for now. 
God above, I am so tired, like wanting to sleep right here in the Starbucks. That's my getting 7 hrs of sleep last night, I guess. :( I hate when I get tired while writing, feels lke a type of resistance that I don't know how to get around. I suppose if I were to go and actually sleep when I feel tired, I probably wouldn't get tired.  
The plot holes are freaking me out and not sure how to resolve or where to focus my efforts.  I'm realizing many of my descriptive scenes can be much longer than they currently are. I used to elaborate too much on parts of the scene that don't matter (saying hello) and when I cut that down, I think I also reduced the amount of description I used. 
I AM getting better, or at least more knowledgeable. My instincts are starting to feel like they are more than just blind fumblings. But LORD this is a lot of work. 
One thing I am beginning to realize: Probably when I'm like "WAIT HOW DOES THIS PLOT WORK" it may be worth just writing the scene a few different ways and seeing which one fits best. That seems so exhausting but it may be more reasonable than committing whole hog to whatever nonsense comes out of the pen first. 

# DECEMBER 2018

## 2018.12.03
Okay, well, I haven't been here in 8 days. I've thought about the book a fair amount but not enough to stay in the world. I'm reading Emergent Strategy which is helping me remember the brain space I was in last year while writing. 
I'm really writing this as a warm up to actually getting to work. Plan is to do 15 hours in December. A hair less than November but it feels sustainable. 
Today I spent only 12 minutes, but I needed to get oriented before my big session tomorrow. And I feel I've done it! The answer is: Open files until one of them tells you how to work on it. (I also looked on github to see what I haven't touched in a while. Very handy.)

## 2018.12.09
Turns out I had bronchitis so I have been mostly focused on sleeping and caring for my body. Hard to want to sit and write with a splitting sinus headache and violent cough. I'm still feeling shaky and frankly very tired. I also am scared of the novel now, having been away so long, and don't really want to jump in.  But today is a writing retreat day and dammit I'm gonna get into the swing of things. I think the daily engagement during early November was really crucial to keeping up momentum--even if I can only get like 15 minutes in I think touching the material every day would be a big help. Anyway, enough putting off the inevitable, time to dive into a scene. 
I've spent a fair amount of time today just moving things around. It feels both finicky & pretty relevant. I need to be able to dip back in more easily and the three thousand versions of the plot that are floating around really don't help. I need *one* that's canonical. I'm clearly not the writer who can hold this all in my head at once.  
I find I have something inside me that says: Yes, this is the right way. No, that's the wrong way. It's not honestly a great weathervane at this point--it pulls me in too many directions, doesn't thread the needle quite.  But I have it. It's in there. And that's a great relief. 
Just re-arranged my day as I'm starting to feel some novel momentum of some small amount--not time to switch gears, methinks. 
Okay, got 2 hours in. I want to touch this much more frequently--daily if possible until it's done. 

## 2018.12.10
Writing at the end of a long day, but it feels good to have my hands on it. Lots of interruptions from family members just wanting to catch up, but I felt okay about it for the most part. Tomorrow morning it's time to get up early and do so much!! What I will do I don't know, but DO IT I SHALL.

## 2018.12.11
Reading Witch Elm last night and feeling gobsmacked by dialogue. Also by the first person. So today I will try both. 
Another thing I'd like to try is establishing the Delvers as good earlier--Paul's read of them was sinister only so I need to anchor them early on as good. 
I still avoided any dialogue at all! But an opening scene is developing. I think I like it if it's not too ham-handed.  God, this is going to take the rest of my life to finish. 

## 2018.12.12
All day I've been feeling excited about getting to work tonight, and while my thoughts aren't deeply in the novel, the fact that they're there at all--and that they're positive!-- feels like a big win and confirmation of my daily-touches theory of noveling. 
Writing some early novel scenes because I think it would be good to have a little bit of a slower pace at the beginning, something to establish our characters before their lives get wrecked by everything. 
Tomorrow I want to start with scene 29 and write how Lo decides that she WILL go to the Well (the scene where she sings with a bird).

## 2018.12.13
Got a late start due to wanting to bond with family who are off for the day.  And then got interrupted with a Christmas question. That is the nature of a writing life, maybe. But I don't feel the anger as strongly as some days when this happens. I'll get there. 

## 2018.12.14
Shoving in a little scrap of time, not sure where to focus and not getting much done. 

## 2018.12.15
Remembering the point of these notes--to track *how* I approach this. Right now I'm just picking random scenes until I find one I can sink my teeth into. It's slow and not super structured. But it's how I'm doing it.
Today I spent some time brainstorming and trying to think about how this society actually functions economically and politically and stuff. It's a lot and really hard to sort out. I wish I were more the leap-before-you-look type, but you know, I yam what I yam.  I think I'm starting to feel the story really clicking in some places and wanting to hook the adjacent puzzle pieces together--to work from the front to the back--and since I want extra stuff at the beginning, solving those problems feels like something of a blocker.  A lot of the questions I have left to me feel HARD (like what's the actual threat) and just *have* to be resolved, by hook or by crook. I think. At least that's how it feels. So I'm just throwing myself against them. At some point I wonder if I need to step away so I can come back and read it with fresh eyes, but I don't feel ready for that. It feels like I'm still so early in the process and there *must* still be work I can do to get this closer to done before that. 

## 2018.12.16
Today I've been putting off coming to the book. Maybe time to find a new spot to work on.  I thought I started a scene somewhere about the battles, the lost towns, but I can't find it now....I'll try again.  
Okay, still mostly just worked on the plot. Just trying to hammer it into submission.  Tomorrow I'd like to work some more on the plot, I think. I want to figure out what the fungus is, how we can cure the tree itself since the song cures the humans. I think this is the wonky and technical part? Or maybe I'm just avoiding writing but I keep hitting questions I dont' know the answer to. And struggling to figure out if I can keep the book I originally meant to write or if it's something else altogether. And if that's okay.

## 2018.12.17
I figured out how I want the Delvers to initially ask Lo to join them. I think that the scene does a lot for fleshing out Lo, and also for helping me discuss what the issues are (since I have to explain them to Lo). Lo DOES wear cardigans. I don't know why! What the fuck!  Soon (tomorrow?) I want to organize the segments further--into the steps of the hero's journey. 

## 2018.12.18
Okay! Today I will organize scenes further into...segments? I dunno. Steps of the hero's journey because I am leaning on that like the crutch that it is. Because crutches help you walk and I am HERE for any help I can get. 
Okay, having done that, there are things I've learned. Just because LO's story is organized via Hero's Journey doesn't mean the whole story fits in to that rubric. There are definitely things that need to happen that don't fit the segment that I'm just sticking in there because I think that's roughly when it actually happens.  Also realizing Fi has her own journey to go on through the book that I need to work out. I love Fi. She's really my fave character.  
All that said....we're getting there. We're about 60000 words and still have maybe another 10-15k that needs to be written. Then...rewritten. And rewritten. You know.  But that's fine. 

## 2018.12.20
Missed yesterday. Had a plan that filled up the whole evening and didn't get to it. Still, one day in twelve is okay. I am fleshing out the scene with the three Delvers, and feeling a political edge to that situation start to develop. I naturally chose as my Delver-protagonist the one that is innocent in her heart, bad at politics--though perhaps she'll succeed despite her discomfort. It's feeling good to expand the Delver stuff. 
I am also feeling some inspiration from the Witch Elm. Eg. right now I'm in the middle of reading a like...40 page scene? That is entirely a conversation in front of a fireplace.  There's very little movement, action to the thing--just description of the way dialogue is delivered, the protagonists mind spinning with revelation and theories, and the dialogue itself. It helps that Tana French absolutely slays at dialogue. But still--she just goes and goes, and the whole thing feels incredibly real, like I've been inside the Ivy House, like I'm the one who has to weigh the new information, and she goes at SUCH LENGTH. It inspires me to look for new ways to write, better ways to phrase, new details, it gives me permission to enter the minds of the characters at more length. I'm sure this won't be the Witch Elm, but I'm happy to be learning from it. 

## 2018.12.22
Missed yesterday as well. So I'm not writing every day right now, but I'm *also* not missing two. So...this could work out okay. I'm about an hour and change behind my goal.  But still. What to work on now?
I'm sure it's just the Witch Elm, but I am REALLY WANTING to write this story in the first person. If I did that, though, which first person? Unless it's multiples, but that seems insane.  There's something about explanatory text that just *works* in the first person. Like, a person talking to you will fill things in for you if you don't know. 
But I would need to understand which scenes couldn't happen, or at least not the same way. Either someone would have to come tell Lo/whoever the narrator is about them, or Lo would have to sort it out in the way Toby does. And I frankly don't know if I have it in me to re-write the whole damn thing. I know that's a thing people do but I'm not sure it wouldn't lead to a massive rage quit on my part. We'll see, I guess, if I keep feeling this push to write first person, if I start writing first person and love it? Maybe then we'll get it done. ANYWAY just wanted to talk about it so I could get it out of my system. 
SO many of my characters feel just like milquetoast people with no personality. I think of Melissa in the Witch Elm--her sunniness, her lack of personality, in many ways she was just a ray of sunshine in the book.  She had a bit of challenge that had to do with her mother.  But the thing that makes her interesting: A) You never really know what's going on under that happy facade, and when you find out that that yes, she actually is just good and just wants to help, despite all the shit, it gives the happy facade a depth. and B) When she basically tells Toby to stop investigating, and you realize she loves him so much she doesn't even really care if he murdered Dominic, again the happiness takes on a deeper cast, it becomes more complicated and interesting. 
RE: the Spanish Missionaries and stuff, I am becoming more and more convinced this specific history cannot be in the book. It feels like erasure, unless I am here to say that the Delvers, or the people in the book (like the heroes, all the characters) are in fact native people who lived when the rest of us just lemminged ourselves out of existence, or something, and it feels weird for me to be the one telling that story. We shall see.
I am so tired and going to stop. TWO HOURS OF NOVELING IS A LOT. Uff da. (And yet I can't quite convince myself to stop. I wanna get this last winter frizi. I've done good work today and am proud of myself.  Looking forward to this book being done, even if it's terrible. I'm starting to feel like I understand the magic behind all of this. The magic/science/threat as it all fits together. GOOD JOB ME YOU GOT THIS.

It's starting to look like an every-other-day stretch. Hard to feel bad about that given that it's the holidays, we've been displaced from our room, we have so many house guests, yadda yadda. I'm still feeling pretty okay about it. And really, the thing Steven Pressfield says is true: The enemy in an endurance enterprise is not time. The enemy is Resistance. So if I can keep up my spirits, can keep feeling like the effort is worth my time, that's the main part of the battle. 
Reading his book, I'm feeling a shortage of information on: the All is Lost moment, and the accompanying epiphanal moment, who is the villain and what is the villain speech. There's some good questions on POV and I still need to figure out the concept and theme exactly.  Like, I am starting to worry that I'm just putting together a rollicking story that doesn't have a point. He does say that as long as you have an ironclad intuitive sense of the theme you don't gotta articulate it, but I'm not sure I have that either. Still--I can sorta imagine the book I want this to be, just have to keep chipping away until it starts to resemble the book in my mind. 
Okay, well, I worked. I worked a fair amount and don't fully understand where I got. Anyway it's time to be done and I need to kill this Xin so I can move on. I did good work today, at least that's what I'm telling myself. I think these structural questions are both important and kind of distracting--they're not *actually writing*, they're planning and plotting. Maybe that's enough. Maybe. I don't really understand or know so I'm just trusting that i'll find the right balance.

I'm scratching out a tiny bit of writing time even though I'm lost in some feelings/exhaustion around the holidays and family stuff. I have a lot on my mind and very little of it is this book. But Paul got me a Write Every Day pin and I am here to live up to that tiny piece of mass-produced metal.  What to do today?  I'm gonna try a few hundred words from the "we" POV. 
Okay, I gave up on "we" but I started writing it from Fi's perspective. I don't know yet if that's any good. There are plenty of scenes that would be tough to write from Fi's perspective, but perhaps they'd be okay. It's sorta nice having Lo be a person whose head we don't quite get to enter. But I'm not sure Fi is correctly positioned to make everything work, either. Like, as Lo is sorting out the mysteries, Fi doesn't know about that (at least not totally).  Fi has to come to Lo's side too.  Potentially I could write things like Well, this is how Lo told me about it, sorta a specific omniscient narrator? I am...not sold. 
The other thing is, I want to know *how* to solve this problem. Right now it feels like my only option is to write it all from that perspective to find it out.

Work is super slow and it's taking SO MUCH will power not to work on this while things are slow. Wah-wah. Anyway. Time to hammer out 10 mins of work. I picked a bad sentence and started teasing out an actual story from the skeleton I had sketched there. Not a bad strategy though I barely wrote three sentences. I re-read the Fi point of view stuff, and it only got life in the scene where Fi acctually sees Lo. The other stuff, the framing stuff? Meh.

Reading "Beating the Story". Wondering if I'm reading too much, should write more, or if I should, like, involve another human. 
Reading the stuff about protagonist types has me kiiiinda lost. I know Lo is not Iconic--she has to change. I think she is transformational?  I'm starting to see the plot like this: 

Lo gets the quest             Lo writes the song she promised     Lo decides which song to use and executes   
________________________________________________________________________
                            \							        /
                             \	         				       /
                              \_______________________________/
                                   Lo writes a secret song       

So she both has to execute the tactical work of figuring out the threat, and writing the songs, but the real climax is in many ways the moment she decides which song to use and moves forward with it.  So the emotional arc for her of rejecting the Delvers and trusting herself.  
Also every exercise I try to do (e.g. what's the throughline?) I come up with about 17,000 answers. I feel so much nuance that I fear the story is an invertebrate, just lots of overlapping shell bits and no spine.  Why can't I commit to solitude to belonging or stability to chaos or society vs individual? They all seem right, and certainly there will be lots of ways that the story moves. Why can't I just PICK one. wszwa				ZAWAQ
Thanks, Caesar.  Reading more about dramatic characters, I really like the idea of poles and the way the dramatic resolutio can literally include those two words. Also inspired by his statement that writing a woman protagonist that isn't open vs. closed/free vs. oppressed/innocence vs. experience.  I'm wondering if the story *can* be more dramatic than tactical, though lord knows Lo has actual work to do that's more than just sitting around talking to people.  Of course, I'm also sitting here wondering if I could layer on dramatic poles as part of a transformational hero.  
The story right now feels a bit flat and formulaic/adventure-y/pulp-y.  And that feels unsatisfying, though I do know there is room for a formulaic story to transcend it all. Just as there is room for a literary story to put a person to sleep.  UGH. SLEEP TIME.
