I want to document my process for editing a novel, because I've never done it before and will likely forget the details over the MONTHS OR YEARS ~~OF SUFFERING~~ of work I'm undertaking. 

# 2017.11.01-2017.11.30
Writing the novel in one big intense go as part of NaNoWriMo.

# 2018.07.12
Re-read the novel at a writing retreat. Highlighted bits and tried to allocate to beginning/middle/end. 
Cut the draft into pieces, and created index cards for each "scene".

# 2018.11.01
Started trying to edit. Can't find my super helpful cut-up draft, but did find index cards. 

# 2018.11.02
Going through files and moving them into their proper location--though I got stuck on the first one which is barely a scene and more of a passing thought. Started rewriting it and need to find the narrative hook that will make this into something worth reading. 
Also need to sort out how I will name my chunks of text, and if I need to/want to retain the index cards. Either in their own format or maybe on github as cards there. Hmmm.
Ooh! I just dug up the paper copy that got all taped together back in July. Let's see if this still makes any sense to me....
Decided I would use #todo to mark things that need work directly in the text so I can just grep for them later.

I'm starting to feel where there needs to be more writing -- things need to be contextualized. Like maybe I can start to see how one begins to shape a chapter--but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I wrote some new stuff--feeling all filled up by this beautiful fall atmosphere I've missed so many years here. Also just feeling weird about this project and self-conscious and...I don't know. 
Sorting through my mind for something to do: I first turn to Revising Prose but am stymied by an example he claims is simple. I then google "How to outline", feeling that things might go easier if I had an outline of *some sort* instead of *no sort*.  I find an interesting "snowflake method" that feels related to what I am doing--sketching out the barest outlines and then filling it into something more like a novel. (Admittedly he says to do that part first and THEN write the novel.). I've now written several single sentences a la NYT Bestsellers List and they're all too long and also kind of bad. Partially the book is just tough to summarize. Reading a review of the Witch Elm makes me feel...I dunno, jealous? They all seem so great...straightforward 8 word summary, massively awesome book. I CAN DO THIS BUT IT *IS* HARD.
I started working on some of the Great Mourning stuff, thinking I can reshape it into a history written by the Delvers, which I love...we start with trusting that but then change to seeing it in a bad light as Lo does.  I just really need to sort out the shape of this story, to stop just sketching the situations and shying away from the details.  But, we'll get there. Fractal snowflakes.

Got a later start than I wanted this morning, but really enjoying the process so far. Last night Paul suggested I just write out the plot as I know it, which I did today and it is starting to feel manageable. Probably great swaths of things will be removed. I need to figure out what exactly make the Delvers bad and what exactly motivates the Bad Guys. I think I have an interesting story and I don't think that masculinity can be the only evil.  
Trying to just be patient and to keep reading--I may have solved some of these issues already (like what's the actual bad stuff??) and am overdoing the work. So trying to at least read each scene as I cut it up and to summarize it. Then adding the summary to a card on the GitHub project to try to get that all out in the open. 
I think this may be a five-act structure so I am gonna need some learning on how to do that. Act 1: Meet characters. Act 2: Meet Delvers. Act 3: Lo strugles to sort out secret. Act 4: Lo finds the Delvers have fucked with her, Act 5: Lo blows it all to hell. 
Realizing that in some ways obsessively organizing is helping me get there, helping me cut this into pieces small enough to handle. So I'm going through and renaming scenes semantically/descriptively, and making sure all files are CamelCase. Starting to see some scenes are already in the wrong spots. Also updating GitHub cards with both the summary and the file name.

I'm proud of myself for stopping Norsemen even though NO ONE ELSE wanted to. 
I'm starting to feel like maybe the tree is a red herring or ...I don't know. It might need to be something else.  The story right now has a lot more to do with human foibles and I'm not sure at all what will make the tree into something reasonable/logical. 
Got through the middle section of the papers. A lot of it is just condensing things into files they belong in.  I'm starting to get a sense for parts of the story that are either insufficiently coupled with the themes or just plain random/bad. I start to feel a bit that I'm not quite following the story I set out to write, but I'm hoping I can get there. Hoping I can paint an amazing society with lots of cool elements that also gets disrupted by something even cooler. Things I value: equality, environmental concern, close knit communities, lack of genders. Creativity can be disruptive, individuality can be disruptive. I also want the villain to be really good, to make *sense* why they're destroying this awesome thing, to be a bit sympathetic even. 
The outline is getting a little wild and wooly but I think it's okay. I still need to pick a single sentence, but I'm not quite sure yet what the story is! 
Also did some slight clean-up as I went, removing some "a bit" and "just" and "is" boring words. Still need to work out who kicks who. What's the driving force from one scene to the next. I suck at this but I'm getting better every day.

There's a lot here, and I'm still wafflign on some of the biggest decisions -- what is actually the climax? What's actually happening here? Sometimes I hit on a solution that feels VERY RIGHT but I'm hesitant to commit because what if I have to throw everything else out?  I think the answer is to keep working, to keep smoothing off the rough edges. Many of these scenes are terrible anyway, so if I DO throw them out, what's the loss? 
Am I stuck too much in outlining level? I can't decide if I should sink down into the scenes or stay at the 10,000 foot view.

# 2018.11.08
Yesterday I read some Pressfield and worked a bit on the plane--mostly thinking. Today I snuck a little chunk of time to work some of the rough edges off--to formalize how to make this into Hero's Journey, and got some exciting ideas. Lo stays at the Well, for example, and is driven off by Bad Delvers. 
I'm now stuck on a whole thing with the tree--how do the Delvers get their power, what's the relevance of the harvest, etc. We'll get there but ugh big questions all around.

Well, the blessing of a delayed flight is more time to write in the (relatively) comfortable gate area instead of on the tiny airplane seat.  
Today I'm writing what I feel is the first scene of the book. It's all starting to feel a touch cliched (like I've read this scene before, because I have, in Harry Potter during that one Quidditch scene) but it's also starting to feel good. Like, a lot of times I realize now, I start a new paragraph because I've run out of steam.  I am beginning to realize that, in fact, there may be such a thing as a thesis statement even in fiction, that each paragraph has a certain logic/scope to it that isn't random. I keep putting the thesis statement at the end of the previous paragraph. 
What exactly did I THINK paragraphs did in fiction? I feel now I have been reading so ignorantly, assuming talent/nature/instinct would guide me when in fa t it, like all things, is artifice and needs my help. 
Goddam I am tired and totally unable to focus. But I've written (or started writing) the other side of the murder. It's unlikely I'll need both...BUT I do need to know how it all goes down and I need to figure out more about what's going on. Is it a poison in the water? Is the bubbleweed ruined? Or is it something else altogether? Whatever it is, I think it needs to be solved with song--although. Although I think then the intiating incident needs something to mirror the singing. Or it needs something to mirror the communal effort that is our final scene.

SD HistCon, as usual, proved a detriment to my writing life.  But I didn't ruin myself.  I did drink too much on Sunday night and then slept a ton Monday. Tuesday I also didn't feel good so slept that day--hence not getting back to it for almost 5 days. Still, here I am, and well, it went okay.  I've started trying to organize things slowly.  Numbered a bunch of sections now that I've broken it into first, second and third acts--so I am starting to have something that might look like a legible draft if not for the bus-sized plot holes. 
I can't tell if the Pressfield book is actually helpful or not. It feels like it gives me some structure to aim for, but also I feel like crap when I can't write something insanely brilliant. Like, yes, every moment of the Godfather IS intentional and on-theme.  I'm not sure I'm there yet (let's be frank, I'm sure I'm NOT there yet).  So, part of me thinks maybe it just makes my standards too high. And part of me thinks that it's too vague as it is, that there is ever more to learn and study. And there is. 
The closer I get to writing the way I want to, the farther I feel. It's exhausting. 
Realizing also that I'm about 50% of the way through the month and less than 25% of the way to my reduced goals. But...once I get started on things I tend to pick up speed, I think. So let's hope tomorrow morning I can get up very early and write for at least an hour. 

# 2018.11.15
This morning I realized I wish I had been posting blogs as I went.  Maybe I still will--I'm "halfway" done but nowhere near the finish line. 
Today I'm actually re-writing a scene instead of just moving things around and feeling overwhelmed.  So that feels good.  Things are starting to feel coherent and I notice a pattern--if I stay with it for too long in any given session, I get demoralized.  But the beginning of a sesssion usually feels pretty good.  My mind is fresh and not tired with wondering what all is going to happen. 
I did blog about it! That felt good. As soon as it was done I realized I maybe should be sending to my newsletter instead, but that felt...not right. So I didn't. I'd rather burn those decision cycles on the book than on the details of the sharing. So I shared and moved on. 
Two things: I looked up the 3 act breakdown of Hero's Journey and feel glad that I correctly intuited where the breaks are. Also, I am simplifying the number of characters.  And will need to find a specific model for Lo so she can be a real person.
