# OUTLINE 

## Tara's Kinda Rough Plot Summary to Just Figure Out If I Know What Happens In This Book Chronologically


Rough outline:
* Centuries ago, a man was sent on a mission to the New World--to embed a sonic weapon in a sacred place that would accomplish WHAT EXACTLY. 
* During the seven-year harvest of bubbleweed, Lo stumbles upon a double murder--a crime not scene in centuries.  Worse yet--the murder victims were both Delvers, and they seemed to have killed *each other*. Lo flees the scene of the crime, and hides out. 
* Our protagonist, Lo, is lonely and unhappy with SOMETHING--she needs something. 
* A red-headed person appears on her doorstep with a mission from the Delvers (an organization that Lo wanted to join but was rejected from as a baby)--there is an evil growing in the world and the Delvers believe Lo can help.  The red-head had a vision of seven robed figures around a tree, singing as the world burned. 
* Fi guides Lo to the Delver HQ, where she is given the mission and begins to see something is awry with the delvers. 
* Lo, with the help of Su and Fi, begins researching the mission from centuries ago to try to uncover the cure. 
* The bad force begins awakening in certain people, causing them to become selfish and stingy TO WHAT END? One of those people is Lo's lover, who eventually turns on her. WHAT IS THE MECHANISM FOR CONVERSION? DOES LO'S LOVER TURN EARLY OR IS IT A LATE BETRAYAL?
* Lo eventually breaks down and tells Su/Sun everything there is to know. Su gets involved and goes to the next town over to see if things are better/worse there (moto scene)
* Lo discovers her history with the Delvers.
* Lo has a mysterious encounter with a lot of birds
* Lo discovers one of the Delvers is leading the betrayal.
* Lo tracks them out to an abandoned military installation, where their device is being built to unleash the badness. WHAT IS THE BADNESS. Lo realizes that in the past everyone had been creative and had been able to share their ideas with anyone.  She realizes the histories are wrong about that and the Bad Guys have also figured out radio broadcasting again. 
* The tree has been destroyed! How can they complete the sacred ritual? (I'm sta)
* Somehow Lo, Fi & five others make it to the sacred tree to complete the song.  I think a bad guy interrupts it and eventually birds turn to Lo and bow to her.  She has SOMEHOW destroyed both the bad guys and the Delvers.  A new world dawns. 


Okay, so the Delvers control everyone with singing--a sort of sonic tuning that keeps them calm and unified. They have destroyed mass broadcasting and national media The bad guys are uncovering ancient radio towers 

Delvers = collective, like ants or bees. Control people with sound & hormones, very difficult to infiltrate, militaristic stuff is deeply buried, haven't had to defend themselves much. 
Bad Guys = loners, like cats. Controlling/building a radio broadcast network to ruin the Delvers and take them over (better land, more water)
Lo = the blend of both, individuality within the collective. Lo is creativity.  Lo unleashes song writing on everyone. That's how song birds are involved. 
How do the Delvers get destroyed at the end? Their tactics are shown to be vulnerable to corruption, each person must guard their own reactions.

Things I love about the original version: 
Humans are very responsible with their emotions, and have huge toolboxes for letting go of bad things and managing their emotional responses. 
It's a society that values close relationships, that doens't define gender, that has a much lower human population than our current one. 



#todo: what is the title? 

After the Great Mourning, society is stable--but a new threat forces an amateur historian to make a difficult choice. 

An amateur musicologist joins forces with a plant witch to stop a threat no one else can even understand--but they risk everything in the process. 


#todo: actually understand the nature of the threat

#todo: Don't freak out about how much there is todo. 




PRELUDE: The Pale Man is infected with the badness. [Still need to understand what the badness is...]

# Fi discovers the tree.
