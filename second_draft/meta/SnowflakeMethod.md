## ONE SENTENCE VERSION:

#todo: Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your novel. Something like this: “A rogue physicist travels back in time to kill the apostle Paul.” (This is the summary for my first novel, Transgression.) The sentence will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This is the big picture, the analog of that big starting triangle in the snowflake picture.

In a world that has healed from the modern apocalypse, seeds from the past begin to threaten an overly stable society. 

Long after society collapsed, the Delvers keep order--until one person saves and destroys the world in a moment. (20)

A bicycling historian saves the world from an inflexible religious order and a historical evil all at once. (17)

A rejected healer turned historian discovers the secret that will save the world from an ancient evil--but will she be able to stop the unraveling of the world she loves? 

A rejected healer, a historian and a small child are trapped in an abandoned industrial facility, threatened by a man hellbent on undoing the social order.  

THOUGHTS: We need a real threat, not just "We're going to stop you!"

A centuries-old secret threatens to unravel the peaceful world of the Delvers, unless Lo can stop it--but will she have the temerity to risk the very structures she is trying to protect? (35)

Hundreds of years from now, humanity has found peace--but a secret threatens to come to light that will destroy everything. (No characters.)

Lo has to solve the puzzle before the bad guys outnumber the good. 

In a world where sound is everything, an amateur historian finds herself at the crux of society--choosing who will win and who will lose. 

After Fiona abandons the religious cult that raised her, she discovers a secret that threatens the very existence of the cult--will she choose them or will she choose herself?

As the anniversary of the Great Mourning approaches, everything is chaos. Dark forces have taken a few Delver towns and now the Delvers are employing the most dangerous weapon they have (Lo) in a desperate gamble to stave off the darkness.  But Lo doesn't get there in time so by the time the threat is stopped, most of the Delvers are dead. Lo and Fi have to bring back society in their own image. 

I like this summary  -- Lo is the force of creativity that causes some destruction but brings about something marvelous.
