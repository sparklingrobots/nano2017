### Hero's Journey

#### ACT ONE
1. hero starts in ordinary world

Lo and her friends are in the forest preparing for the year's big harvest. All the Delvers are here, it's a big chaotic time. The inciting incident is witnessed by all but only understood by fi and Lo.  One Delver is infected by the tree sap that has come out from the infected part of the tree--and turns to murder the other Delver.  The murderer escapes and runs to the next town that doesn't have Delvers--where the enemies of the Delvers take them under their wing. (Later, Un who is already kind of evil comes to the tree and also gets infected. And the OG Bad Delver figures it out and starts using the poison intentionally. )

2. hero receives call to adventure

SOMEONE comes to Lo with a summoning from the Delvers, Lo ignores it and continues her normal life. Whatever that is.

3. hero rejects call

Lo runs from the scene of the crime. She tries to push it from her mind, assuming the Delvers will address it and calm everyone--but the ongoing silence from the Delvers drives her to extreme distress/anxiety.

Io starts falling apart and things get bad in Lo's personal life. 

4. hero meets mentor. mentor gives hero courage to continue

Fi takes matters into her own hands and visits Lo. She shares her fear and bolsters Lo's courage.  Lo sings with the bird and somehow knows she has to go.

#### ACT TWO -- Act Two belongs to the VILLAIN. Make sure the villain is front and center all the dang time. 

5. hero crosses threshold, enter special world.

Fi and Lo travel to the Well

6. hero encounters enemies and allies, undergoes ordeal that will serve as their initiation

Lo meets lots of Delvers, and begins to understand more about the world of the Delvers and starts to see the dark side of them. She meets both good and bad Delvers and experiences two things: 

1) She is threatened by a Delver, or has other scary Delver experience.
2) Council of Delvers, initiating her into their ranks so she can do her work. 

(OMG MAYBE LO DOES ALL THE RESEARCH IN THE WELL AND NOT AT HER OWN HOME, HENCE SHE GETS A LOT OF TIME TO SPEND WITH THEM AND LEARN ABOUT THE BADNESS) (POSSIBLY ALSO WHY SU HAS TO GO ON HER BIKE RIDE?)

7. hero confronts villain, acquires treasure

As Lo finishes her song and prepares to share it with the Delvers, the Queen comes to listen to the song. The effect on the queen is extreme, and is broadcast throughout the entire Well.  Those who have been badly infected die. she is waylaid by the Bad Delvers, who try to kill her and destroy her work. Her battle with them and eventual defeat are the biggest personal challenge for her. 

#### ACT THREE

8. the road back. hero escapes special world, trying to 'get home'

She runs away from the Well. Fi and a few other Delvers flee with her. They need to find a new way to broadcast since the Well is destroyed in the escape (fire?) (everyone deafened or otherwise wounded?)

9. villains pursue hero. hero must fight/escape again. 

They follow!  Perhaps they take refuge in the old hotel, or perhaps they simply end up there via hijinks.

10. hero returns home with treasure, reintegrates into ordinary world, but now as changed person, thanks to their ordeal and experiences on the journey

After escaping, Lo and co. finally unleash the song, fighting off the bads.  Not only is Lo changed, but the whole world is undone--and time for a new beginning.

## ONE SENTENCE VERSION:

Todo: Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your novel. Something like this: “A rogue physicist travels back in time to kill the apostle Paul.” (This is the summary for my first novel, Transgression.) The sentence will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This is the big picture, the analog of that big starting triangle in the snowflake picture.

## Tara's Kinda Rough Plot Summary to Just Figure Out If I Know What Happens In This Book Chronologically

“Music directly imitates the passions or states of the soul; hence, when one listens to music that imitates certain passion, he becomes imbued with the same passion; … In short, if one listens to the wrong kind of music he will become the wrong kind of person; but, conversely, if he listens to the right kind of music he will tend to become the right kind of person.”

~ Aristotle, Politics XIII

Background: 
* Centuries ago, a man was sent on a mission to the New World--to embed a sonic weapon in a sacred place that would accomplish WHAT EXACTLY.
* Our protagonist, Lo, is lonely and unhappy with SOMETHING--she needs something. 


This society is relatively small and isolated, ruled by a class called the Delvers. The Delvers are a mix of highly trained and naturally gifted--they are able to manipulate emotions with sound as well as by touch.  They are extremely sensitive to emotional states and can calm entire populations.  Some Delvers have particular gifts -- eg Fi has a connection with plants. They acheived this level of skill through a combination of skill and because of a very rare and specific tree they use to make potions. They use the potions both for themselves and also for calming the population around them. 

The Delvers rule over our society, but they also send emissaries to recruit/kidnap children with natural skills to bring them into the fold. They have been doing this for generations so most of the group is unusually sensitive--they are just untrained, used for breeding stock.  The other societies have many different ways of being. The Delvers started out as an organization devoted to peace keeping, higher evolution of humans, enlightenment, and other good things.  But over time they lose focus on what they are here for and start to take power for power's sake.  The Delvers manage foreign relations with other communities in some way that keeps everyone safe but it's not clear how they do that to the people in the community. There are not many outside visitors though within a county-area you are welcome to travel among towns. 

There is a new strain of Delvers who are not at all dedicated to the principles of the Delvers--they are just after power. These power-hungry Delvers end up merged with another group of Delvers who who don't agree with the policy of taking children against their will. The Bad Delvers and the ones who don't like the kidnapping have decided they want to stop the Delvers from existing.  They start collaborating with another WAY WORSE culture that still has a lot of technology (radios). They plan to broadcast signals that will disable the Delvers. The main BA delver is naive to the avarice and evil of the outsiders. (NEED CHARACTER)

At the seven yr harvest of something cool, there is a murder of two Delvers--one bad apple Delver was trying to ruin the harvest; one good apple Delver tried to stop them and they both ended up dead. 

Lo sees this happen, but runs away before anyone can find her. 

The Delvers hide the murder for a while, Lo starts to fall apart. More bad things start happening around town. 

The Delvers meet and decide Lo has to be the one because of her Secret History.

* A red-headed person appears on Lo's doorstep with a mission from the Delvers (an organization that Lo wanted to join but was rejected from as a baby)--there is an evil growing in the world and the Delvers believe Lo can help.  The red-head had a vision of seven robed figures around a tree, singing as the world burned. 
* Fi guides Lo to the Delver HQ, where she is given the mission and begins to see something is awry with the delvers. 


Lo goes to the Well to receive the mission and begin her research and training. While she is at the Well, she starts to uncover the plot of the BA Delvers. 

* Lo, with the help of Su and Fi, begins researching the mission from centuries ago to try to uncover the cure. * Lo eventually breaks down and tells Su/Sun everything there is to know. Su gets involved and goes to the next town over to see if things are better/worse there (moto scene) 

* The bad force begins awakening in certain people, causing them to become selfish and stingy TO WHAT END? One of those people is Lo's lover, who eventually turns on her. WHAT IS THE MECHANISM FOR CONVERSION? DOES LO'S LOVER TURN EARLY OR IS IT A LATE BETRAYAL? * Lo discovers one of the Delvers is leading the betrayal.


* Lo discovers her history with the Delvers.

* Lo has a mysterious encounter with a lot of birds

She realizes that the powerful (both GA and BA) Delvers essentially breed the lesser Delvers to increase their powers using mind control. She has to sort out for herself what she thinks the best choice is: Aid and abet kidnappers who keep their society healthy, or aid and abet the people who are going to destroy them and leave their society helpless. She continues her research and learns about the signals that are being broadcast by the BA Delvers + friends. She reverse engineers it, turns it into a signal that will activate the latent powers in everyone. She tests it on Fi and it works. Both BA & GA delvers are terrified of this as their power will be greatly reduced. 

Her choice is made for her when SOMEONE turns on her and tries to murder her in the Well. She escapes but not without putting her recording on repeat at the Well, rendering most of the Well incapable of action. (How does she disable the bads?). She decides she has

~The bads start marching in from their town, thinking the signal has gone out.~ Lo has instead risen her own army of amateur delvers from the society at large.  

* Lo tracks them out to an abandoned military installation, where their device is being built to unleash the badness. WHAT IS THE BADNESS. Lo realizes that in the past everyone had been creative and had been able to share their ideas with anyone.  She realizes the histories are wrong about that and the Bad Guys have also figured out radio broadcasting again. 
* The tree has been destroyed! How can they complete the sacred ritual? (I'm sta)
* Somehow Lo, Fi & five others make it to the sacred tree to complete the song.  I think a bad guy interrupts it and eventually birds turn to Lo and bow to her.  She has SOMEHOW destroyed both the bad guys and the Delvers.  A new world dawns. 

The song has to neutralize the Bads as well. Could it be a song of releasing power/ambition? Could it be the song of mourning that brings them to a halt?  Current theory is they are all bound to the Queen; they have some kind of fungal infection that allows them to communicate very closely but it leaves them susceptible to corruption (which is what the BA Delvers are). This is why the song disables the Delvers so critically--it's very painful for them to be isolated.  

End result I want: Delving is now a distributed skillset among the population.  Peace with neighbors has been achieved, though they are very different from our society. Delvers go there to help teach skills of delving, no longer kidnap--it's a peaceful trade relationship. 


Okay, so the Delvers control everyone with singing--a sort of sonic tuning that keeps them calm and unified. They have destroyed mass broadcasting and national media The bad guys are uncovering ancient radio towers 

Delvers = collective, like ants or bees. Control people with sound & hormones, very difficult to infiltrate, militaristic stuff is deeply buried, haven't had to defend themselves much. 
Bad Guys = loners, like cats. Controlling/building a radio broadcast network to ruin the Delvers and take them over (better land, more water)
Lo = the blend of both, individuality within the collective. Lo is creativity.  Lo unleashes song writing on everyone. That's how song birds are involved. 
How do the Delvers get destroyed at the end? Their tactics are shown to be vulnerable to corruption, each person must guard their own reactions.

Things I love about the original version: 
Humans are very responsible with their emotions, and have huge toolboxes for letting go of bad things and managing their emotional responses. 
It's a society that values close relationships, that doens't define gender, that has a much lower human population than our current one. 

Could the bad thing threaten the tree?  Be the tree? Be inside the tree? 

The tree had a spore in it that came loose when Fi psychically jostled it.  It infected mostly Delvers, who were vulnerable to the signals.  Those Delvers started to get stuck, resentful, isolated, and started turning people to their side. 

The song that Fi saw is indeed a containment spell that has been perverted/forgotten & rewritten by the Delvers in the area, but they don't remember any more where it came from.  So they sing it to the Well instead of the tree. 

The birds in the area know something of the tree.  They know that of the two lines of humans (Delvers & non) they will merge into one better species.  They know that Lo is the one to do it becuase they recognize her from her ancestor/reincarnated self, which is why they declare her King of All Birds. 

The Delvers want to broadcast their fucked up and vaguely fascist views longer distance. So they resurrect an old radio station and start pirate broadcasting.  This is where Lo breaks in at the end of the book and has to disable the device (in retrospect everything about that scene should be Su.  Su is more mechanical and will want to save Io but will not feel SO fucked up by it.)

In the mean time Lo has assembled her group to sing to the tree.  The singing will actually trigger a kind of collapse of the space/time continuum, so all the Protectors will be singing at the same time (why does this one trigger and no other time does?).  And when they do that, the tree will push out the antidote to the Bad Guys.  

But they don't solve it in time to save the Delvers.  And the Bad Guys have proven that this kind of secretive culture & structure is too dangerous.  So Lo knows her next phase in life is teaching the Delver skills to everyoe.  

PRELUDE: The Pale Man is infected with the badness. [Still need to understand what the badness is...]

EXCITING: Willow can regenerate basically if you just stick a branch of it in the earth. Nearly immortal. 

The tree has a long-hidden fungus inside of it which 

They have to sing a song to correct an infection that is spreading from a mold/fungus. The song works by [a long rabbithole on tvtropes later].  

When they sing this song, they broadcast it widely using the transmitter they stole from the warehouse, where the BG were using it to amplify the spread of the virus.

What is the problem? Theme?
 responsibility
Sharing power. 

Mq can be like the old man next to me, doesn't seem to know the words please or thank you and his bubble of influence it's enormous.

8-12 major sequences: how is mine divided?

The radio broadcast at the beginning destroys a few delvers. And infects some others secretly so they turn.  It's a small area of effect because they're just learning. 

Lo had to write the song that counteracts what they did but in so doing she Burns it the last of the delvers control abilities.
