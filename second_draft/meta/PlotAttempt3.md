Okay, let's just lay out the facts of the story. 

“Music directly imitates the passions or states of the soul; hence, when one listens to music that imitates certain passion, he becomes imbued with the same passion; … In short, if one listens to the wrong kind of music he will become the wrong kind of person; but, conversely, if he listens to the right kind of music he will tend to become the right kind of person.”

~ Aristotle, Politics XIII



This society is relatively small and isolated, ruled by a class called the Delvers. The Delvers are a mix of highly trained and naturally gifted--they are able to manipulate emotions with sound as well as by touch.  They are extremely sensitive to emotional states and can calm entire populations.  Some Delvers have particular gifts -- eg Fi has a connection with plants. (How did the Delvers get so good at this? Where do they cull from?)

The Delvers rule over our society, but they also send emissaries to recruit/kidnap children with natural skills to bring them into the fold. They have been doing this for generations so most of the group is unusually sensitive--they are just untrained, used for breeding stock.  The other societies have many different ways of being. The Delvers are mostly really good with a few who are baddish apples.  Still things are progressing as normal. The Delvers manage foreign relations with other communities in some way that keeps everyone safe but it's not clear how they do that. 

The baddish apples are those who don't agree with the policy of taking children against their will--they want to stop the Delvers from existing.  They start collaborating with another WAY WORSE culture that still has a lot of technology (radios). They plan to broadcast signals that will disable the Delvers. The main BA delver is naive to the avarice and evil of the outsiders. (NEED CHARACTER)

At the seven yr harvest of something cool, there is a murder of two Delvers--one bad apple Delver was trying to ruin the harvest; one good apple Delver tried to stop them and they both ended up dead. 

Lo sees this happen, but runs away before anyone can find her. 

The Delvers hide the murder for a while, Lo starts to fall apart. More bad things start happening around town. 

The Delvers meet and decide Lo has to be the one because of her Secret History.

Lo goes to the Well to receive the mission and begin her research and training. While she is at the Well, she starts to uncover the plot of the BA Delvers. She realizes that the powerful (both GA and BA) Delvers essentially breed the lesser Delvers to increase their powers using mind control. She has to sort out for herself what she thinks the best choice is: Aid and abet kidnappers who keep their society healthy, or aid and abet the people who are going to destroy them and leave their society helpless. She continues her research and learns about the signals that are being broadcast by the BA Delvers + friends. She reverse engineers it, turns it into a signal that will activate the latent powers in everyone. She tests it on Fi and it works. Both BA & GA delvers are terrified of this as their power will be greatly reduced. 

Her choice is made for her when SOMEONE turns on her and tries to murder her in the Well. She escapes but not without putting her recording on repeat at the Well, rendering most of the Well incapable of action. (How does she disable the bads?). She decides she has

~The bads start marching in from their town, thinking the signal has gone out.~ Lo has instead risen her own army of amateur delvers from the society at large.  

The song has to neutralize the Bads as well. Could it be a song of releasing power/ambition? Could it be the song of mourning that brings them to a halt? 

End result I want: Delving is now a distributed skillset among the population.  Peace with neighbors has been achieved, though they are very different from our society. Delvers go there to help teach skills of delving, no longer kidnap--it's a peaceful trade relationship.

They have to sing a song to correct an infection that is spreading from a mold/fungus. The song works by [a long rabbithole on tvtropes later].  

When they sing this song, they broadcast it widely using the transmitter they stole from the warehouse, where the BG were using it to amplify the spread of the virus.
