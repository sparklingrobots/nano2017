Raul stayed aroudn [ed note: yes technically i killed him but I might regret that] the spring after the padres left. They hadn't told him he had to stay but he felt that he should, somehow, stay.

Here's some unofficial backstory: 

Lo and Io met in high school or whatever it is you do in this world when you are a teenager.  They met in high school and befcame deeply infatuated with each other.  They were both kind of strange and academic, and they hung out a lot and had ever since.  They liked to find songs together, though Io wasn't much of a singer.  They had fallen in and out of phsyical relationships through the years. 

At present they are not in a physical relationship--Lo is not in a physical relationship with anyone. She cuddles with Io and Su.  

Io loves Lo and always has and is very protective of her, but also somewhat unproductively judgmental. Io is always Lo's harbor in the storm. 


TODO: Write about how relationships heal this world.

The wind carried dust in it as she climbed over the fallen tree to approach the spring. 

She knelt below the tree, in the mud, on the leaves, and bent her head. 

She was lost.  She had found the song, she thought, but she didn't know all the parts. 

She started to sing what she did know: 

Together we grow
We heal together
Together we gather
We love together

And cut short. Her ear had been filled with a piercing pain when she reached the last line--she couldn't tell if it was a bad noise or something else, but her ear was hurting.  

She waited, rocking back and forth on her knees with a hand over her ear. She decided to try again: 

Together we grow
We heal--

Again the pain.  Sooner than last time.  It didn't feel mechanical, it felt almsot--intelligent.  It felt sensitive to what she was doing and why.  She shook her head and drank some water as she waited for the pain to pass. 

After the pain subsided she tried a different song altogether, one she had learned from the archives: 

It's been a long, long time comin', 
But a change's gonna come, yes it is.

The pain didn't appear.  She kept singing. 

[insert two more lines]

It was a song she'd never heard the original performance of, but she had transcriptions of it.  It was a song she loved--she loved the idea that no matter what had happened, change was coming [ed note: is that waht the song is about?] It made her feel better. Whatever was happening now to the Delvers would change, whether or not she succeeded.  Whatever was happening to Lo and Fi and this tree would change.  She felt her inner equilibrium balance out.  

As soon as she tried the original song the pain in her ear was very sharp--she reached for her ear and wondered if she would feel blood.  But after a few seconds of silence, she was fine. 

This was not what she expected.  She hadn't truly expected the song to work with just her voice, but she hadn't expected a negative reaction? Was it the song itself? Was someone fucking with her? 

She stood up, a bit woozy from the pain.  She placed her hands against the bark of the tree, feeling that old papery surface and wishing, as always, that she could know what the tree knows.  She listened to the rustle of the leaves, dried but not yet fallen.

The she heard something a bit different. It sounded like a footstep.  She wasn't an expert but it sounded mostly like a human footstep, with the soft rustle of a windbreaker. 

She whipped her head around and saw a pale person turn and start sprinting away. They were carrying something in their right hand--a small box with some kind of stick or antenna out the top. 

She'd seen this person in the market before.  There was no reason for them to rush off--unless they were somehow responsible for her pain.  

She knew with a sinking feeling they must be.

He'd never been particularly mechanical but this little device had come together nearly on its own. Io, in particular, had been a help--sharing their mechanical knowledge.  Uo [or whatever his name is] could fix a bike or start a fire, but creativity in engineering was not his strong suit.  

He hadn't told Io what the point of the little device was, or who his target was.  He said he was making it to freak out the birds. Which was true--it was very likely going to freak out the birds. 

As they worked, trying different knobs and antenna lengths, they talked.  Uo asked Io abou their childhood, prying so gently at any small wounds until they were bleeding fresh.  Uo could tell by the usual signs, the heart rate elevated, the palms slightly sweaty.  But instead of his previous goals--to see that behavior and then reduce it -- he tried the opposite. 

It was, frankly, terrifying to see Io in that state of rage.  Io had almost never seen anyone so angry, even during training.  Io went from calm and helpful to irrationally angry, afraid of people coming for Lo, mad about sexual promiscuity (that had been a neat trick Io was particularly proud of) and nearly gleeful that the birds who heard this thing might fall from the sky.  
Uo had done good work here.  Now he just needed more people. 

Instead they'd shot the shit
