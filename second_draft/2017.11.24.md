Raul stayed aroudn [ed note: yes technically i killed him but I might regret that] the spring after the padres left. They hadn't told him he had to stay but he felt that he should, somehow, stay.

They had made this journey before.  They had made it so many times and they hated it everytime. 

Fi preferred life outside the Well and now that her abilities were damaged she was dreading going back.  

She set her jaw as they strapped on their helmets and got on the bikes.  Lo noticed that Fi had been nervous, or something--she seemed a bit distressed about something other, new. 

She knew she was supposed to love going back to the Well.  The Delvers all seemed to love the Well, but Fi had never liked it and the situation had only gotten worse.  At home she had friends who cared for her and they had space to live with the plants, to recharge between sessions.  At the Well, she was just one small part of a huge group, an detail only relevant when she was wrong or missing or out of place. 

As they pedaled she remembered when she first left the Well. She had loved it there as a child, or...well, it seemed to her at the time that she liked it but as she got older and had more control over her life, there were details that stood out.  

She remembered hiding. Hiding all the time, running from the more exuberant kids to get quiet time in the forest.  It felt a bit too on the nose when she thought of her current patterns.  She was a good Delver--or, she _had_ been before. But she needed more time to recharge. 

And there seemed to be something just a bit off.  They came together to sing songs about how every last person matters, but the truth was they didn't all matter.  Un and Mq loved the Well, they said it all the time--but they also loved being the center.  They loved knowing what everyone was up to more than they loved everyone. 

And Fi seemed to be the only one who could see it. The holiness of the Delvers, their role as Savior...it blinded non-Delvers to her unhappiness, to the corruption growing in their midst. 

She shook her head.  She was just in a bad mood. 

And yet she felt the need to prepare for the trip to the Well. She felt the usual detachment process begin.  She had tried in the past to stay open; she had the skills from her Delver past to control it.  She had stayed open. She had stayed present. But even that wasn't enough and eventually her mind would close, her eyes would constrict, her ears would stop listening and her body would take over. 

The last trip, after the incident, that had been entirely different.  She was so terrified that she had pushed as hard as she could to get there and her sensors were wide open, all defenses down. 

She'd never seen them see her through the lens of need.  They responded instinctively to her crisis and she remembered what she though the Delvers were supposed to be to each other.  Nurturers, care takers.  They took care of her for the better part of a week, helping her regain control of her senses, opening and closing her emotional apertures.  Her eyes had been a problem--the first person to greet her had been greatly damaged by the flood they received when they locked eyes with her--and they still hadn't managed to help her close them down.  She learned quickly to keep her glasses on, to avoid eye contact.  

And then it started slipping back.  They had a bigger crisis on their hands and she became someone to fetch things, to work, to get things done.  She was no longer particularly relevant.  [Ed Note: this much exposition is eyeroll-y. And difficult for me to write. Hopefully soon it can be actually good scenes instead?]

"What's it like there?" Lo's voice startled her out of her thoughts. She smirked a bit, since Lo couldn't see her face. 

"The Well?  It's..." The thoughts at the forefront of her mind were not what she wanted Lo to hear. She took a breath and let those concerns flow freely out of her. "It's lovely.  I love the ride there, have you been this way?"

"No, not very far. Only to the edge of town."

"Once you get out of town it's beautiful. The sky looks so much bigger as you go down into the valley and the clouds are always in crazy shapes...

"The Well is nice. I don't know what it will be like for you; we almost never have non-Delvers around. But it's a place of great warmth and welcome." 

"Who will I be meeting?"

"I don't know very much about the plans."

Lo didn't say what she thought but wondered why the person who had seen the vision had been sent to fetch her, but didn't know anything about the plans.  She got the sense Fi didn't feel entirely comfortable with the situation, either. 

"Is there any etiquette I need to know? I'd like to make a good impression."

"Un and Mq know about you, but in general things are pretty structured. They'll tell you where to be and when.

"I guess I'd only warn you that it is easy for them to effect you, obviously, and there's sort of a...calming cloud around the place. We tend the overall atmosphere to keep ourselves happy and harmonious, but I would be surprised if you don't feel it...too much.  You might be prepared to feel out of control."

Fi felt bad but didn't feel ready to share more than that.  She couldn't jeopardize the mission, even with her doubts. 

---

Time passed. They fell into silence again.  Fi noted gratefully the dried heads of a field of sunflowers she always looked for. They passed through a small town, mostly ruined, with a few houses that seemed to still have residents--a flat-roofed ranch house with a pumpkin carved and sitting on the steps,  a two-story Victorian with freshish paint on the gingerbread woodwork. 

"Who lives here?"

"I don't know...you know, I've passed through this village more times than I can count and I have never stopped. I've never seen anybody even walking around here.  We always stopped a bit farther--the halfway point."

Lo looked around...the houses seemed well cared for in the midst of crumbling buildings.  A wooden home was completely devoid of paint, the entire thing sagging and slanting off to the side.  The old post office was closed and boarded up.  They pedalled on. 

Fi was right--this was a beautiful ride.  She found something comforting with the soft grade down into the valley, the way the sky opened up above them, the distant ridge of a mountain blue, the land in front of it vaguely pink until it reached the greener base of the valley. A deer watched them from the trees.

At a wider spot in the road, Fi pulled off.  There was a shelter here over a table and picnic bench. Behind the shelter, a spring babbled over some rocks. 

"Here we are."  They stopped and pulled some food out of their bags--cheese, bread, dried meat.  Lo pulled out a jar of good mustard and started making sandwiches. Fi leaned over and stretched their hamstrings until Lo handed them a sandwich. 

"How are you doing, Fi? You seem stressed."

Fi flushed. They'd never been asked by a non-Delver how they were doing and it felt awful. It had to be related to their diminished abilities; they couldn't mask their feelings like they used to and now here was a non-Delver being affected by it. 

"Sorry, I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry." Lo could tell Fi was humiliated by the question.  She's been trying to help. 

They ate in silence, no traffic passing. The bright mustard was great with the fatty spiced salami, and Lo was hungry from the ride. 

"You know, I always wanted to be a Delver." Lo couldn't remember the last time she'd said that out loud--maybe when she met Io when they were 15. 

Fi looked up out of the corner of their eyes, mouth full, nodding encouragement. 

"Yeah, I always thought I'd be good at it."

Fi stayed quiet. 

"I mean, you can see it in my work, can't you? I feel like I've spent my whole life trying to learn what you've known since you were a child."

"It's not all that it looks like." Fi muttered quietly.

"I've been telling myself that my whole life: that it can't be as great as it seems. But it's hard to believe.  I have to learn the songs in my spare time, and I don't have anybody to sing with most of the time. I don't know why they didn't want me."  She drank some water. "But I've made my life anyhow."

"It's ultimately what we all do, isn't it?" Fi said it quietly.  "Shall we sing together? A song of thanks for the food and the ride?"

It was Lo's time to blush.  She'd sung with Delvers countless times but never just two of them at one time, alone.  She was always part of the larger crowd.  
"C'mon, it's fun. I won't be rude about it."

"What song?"  It was always the Delvers who chose the song. 

Fi started the song: 

Hot fire and warm fields of grain
Cool breeze and the glade
We are coming home
We are coming home to be Well

They repeated it twice before Lo joined in.  She didn't know this song, but it came easily to her. 

As soon as Fi could hear their two voices rising together, carried by the valley air, she realized she'd chosen the wrong song. This song was only for Delvers to sing, to sing as they came home to this particular Well.  But it wasn't the wrong song entirely.  

----

Io didn't much like this Fi person hanging around.  Lo's attention was split and she was singing all the time. 

They were sitting at the kitchen table working on some chords for that stupid Delver project.  WHy should Lo help them when all they'd ever done was reject her? 

"I'm headed out." Their departure was so casual they weren't sure Lo noticed they were leaving until they heard her call goodbye when they were down the stairs and halfway out the door.  

They thought about going to the Delvers.  They could tell their emotions were a bit out of whack lately; they'd been feeling increasingly jealous of Lo and Fi.  And normally this is how they fix things, right? They go talk about it, they sing a song and they find a gift fo Lo and for Fi to help them normalize and warm up that relationship.  

But the Delvers had seemed like the wrong solution.  Io wondered if it was time to move on from Lo.  They didn't realize they were already halfway into town when they saw a person walking in the woods.  They said hello and the person--a very pale, sort of forgettable person--said hi back.  Io felt a desire to stop and say hello.  Just to feel some kind of human companionship. But before they could open their mouth to speak, the other person spoke. 

"Howdy, neighbor." The voice was low. Io began to suspect they were a man--it was so rare to see one.  

"Hi there."

"Don't suppose you've seen a small dog around?"

Truthfully Io hadn't been paying the least attention. "Sorry, I didn't notice anything.  Are you missing one?"

"Yeah, my beagle..."  Io felt a powerful wave of sympathy and wanted to help immediately. 

"Aw, a beagle? What's their name?"

"Meatball."

"Let's find Meatball."

When they stopped in front of Io's place several hours later, the pretense of the dog search had been erased from Io's memory entirely.  Their memory of the afternoon was a bit foggy, but they wanted to hang out with Os again. "Want to grab some tea tomorrow?"

"Sure, why don't you come to my place?"

[etc etc]

Lo looked a bit curious as Io came in but didn't ask.  They didn't need to share. [Need to establish a better relationshp sooner.]

Here's some unofficial backstory: 

Lo and Io met in high school or whatever it is you do in this world when you are a teenager.  They met in high school and befcame deeply infatuated with each other.  They were both kind of strange and academic, and they hung out a lot and had ever since.  They liked to find songs together, though Io wasn't much of a singer.  They had fallen in and out of phsyical relationships through the years. 

At present they are not in a physical relationship--Lo is not in a physical relationship with anyone. She cuddles with Io and Su.  

Io loves Lo and always has and is very protective of her, but also somewhat unproductively judgmental. Io is always Lo's harbor in the storm.

As they got closer, Fi could feel the change setting in.  Their attention span felt considerably shorter.  Their nose got stuffed up and their shoulders rose higher.  It was bad enough coming home before, but now...she could tell they weren't sure what to do about her. 

As soon as they got inside, Fi was dismissed to begin preparing the sleeping arrangements for the Well.  They glanced at Lo, worried that she would feel abandoned, but knew they couldn't give too much away or they'd risk punishment from Un or Mq. 

They remembered when they felt special for being close enough to know Un and Mq.  All their childhood they'd seen the leaders and wondered how she could be good enough to know them.  But now that they'd come closer to the leaders, they wished they were back on garden detail.

The wind carried dust in it as she climbed over the fallen tree to approach the spring. 

She knelt below the tree, in the mud, on the leaves, and bent her head. 

She was lost.  She had found the song, she thought, but she didn't know all the parts. 

She started to sing what she did know: 

Together we grow
We heal together
Together we gather
We love together

And cut short. Her ear had been filled with a piercing pain when she reached the last line--she couldn't tell if it was a bad noise or something else, but her ear was hurting.  

She waited, rocking back and forth on her knees with a hand over her ear. She decided to try again: 

Together we grow
We heal--

Again the pain.  Sooner than last time.  It didn't feel mechanical, it felt almsot--intelligent.  It felt sensitive to what she was doing and why.  She shook her head and drank some water as she waited for the pain to pass. 

After the pain subsided she tried a different song altogether, one she had learned from the archives: 

It's been a long, long time comin', 
But a change's gonna come, yes it is.

The pain didn't appear.  She kept singing. 

[insert two more lines]

It was a song she'd never heard the original performance of, but she had transcriptions of it.  It was a song she loved--she loved the idea that no matter what had happened, change was coming [ed note: is that waht the song is about?] It made her feel better. Whatever was happening now to the Delvers would change, whether or not she succeeded.  Whatever was happening to Lo and Fi and this tree would change.  She felt her inner equilibrium balance out.  

As soon as she tried the original song the pain in her ear was very sharp--she reached for her ear and wondered if she would feel blood.  But after a few seconds of silence, she was fine. 

This was not what she expected.  She hadn't truly expected the song to work with just her voice, but she hadn't expected a negative reaction? Was it the song itself? Was someone fucking with her? 

She stood up, a bit woozy from the pain.  She placed her hands against the bark of the tree, feeling that old papery surface and wishing, as always, that she could know what the tree knows.  She listened to the rustle of the leaves, dried but not yet fallen.

The she heard something a bit different. It sounded like a footstep.  She wasn't an expert but it sounded mostly like a human footstep, with the soft rustle of a windbreaker. 

She whipped her head around and saw a pale person turn and start sprinting away. They were carrying something in their right hand--a small box with some kind of stick or antenna out the top. 

She'd seen this person in the market before.  There was no reason for them to rush off--unless they were somehow responsible for her pain.  

She knew with a sinking feeling they must be.

He'd never been particularly mechanical but this little device had come together nearly on its own. Io, in particular, had been a help--sharing their mechanical knowledge.  Uo [or whatever his name is] could fix a bike or start a fire, but creativity in engineering was not his strong suit.  

He hadn't told Io what the point of the little device was, or who his target was.  He said he was making it to freak out the birds. Which was true--it was very likely going to freak out the birds. 

As they worked, trying different knobs and antenna lengths, they talked.  Uo asked Io abou their childhood, prying so gently at any small wounds until they were bleeding fresh.  Uo could tell by the usual signs, the heart rate elevated, the palms slightly sweaty.  But instead of his previous goals--to see that behavior and then reduce it -- he tried the opposite. 

It was, frankly, terrifying to see Io in that state of rage.  Io had almost never seen anyone so angry, even during training.  Io went from calm and helpful to irrationally angry, afraid of people coming for Lo, mad about sexual promiscuity (that had been a neat trick Io was particularly proud of) and nearly gleeful that the birds who heard this thing might fall from the sky.  
Uo had done good work here.  Now he just needed more people. 

Instead they'd shot the shit
