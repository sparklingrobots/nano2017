SUMMARY: Lo feels rage, controls it with meditation. 

This scene needs: a trigger. Why is she doing this? 

She needed to learn to control her rage. 

But everytime she contained it she only felt the pressure grow.  And the rage would grow with it. 

She felt an obsessive need to be better, to prove herself, to know that she was better than these...

She caught herself.  That was where they got their foothold. 

Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.  It's entirely possible Uy was smarter and stronger than her in all ways, but it didn't matter. 

And that was what distinguished them from the humans who came before.  She closed her eyes.  She took a deep breath.  She let the thoughts drain from her, imagined them sliding away from her like water, dripping off her chin and running down the back of her head.  

TODO: Finish meditation scene.
