SUMMARY: Io comes home acting weird. 

Io came in late that night.  Lo had been working on a song most of the day; her voice was tired and she had a mug of herbal tea clasped at her heart.  More than her voice was tired--she was tired.  She had been working so hard and they were stuck.  She was tired of hearing the reports of the Bad Guys causing trouble.  She was tired of having to spend so much time moderating her own emotions--it takes time to meditate, to exercise, and she didn't want to spend the time on it. 

Truth be told she hadn't been getting enough sleep.  It was almost confession worthy, to deny the need for sleep, but she also could fake it just enough.  She could stay up a touch later and get up a touch earlier and get a bit more work done. 

She'd sleep when they solved it.  She knew that Fi would be mad at her--mad that she was being careless when it mattered so much, but she also knew she needed to solve this soon.  She could feel the balance of the scales slipping--she could feel the world sliding toward the Bad Guys, slowly at first and more quickly over the past few days.

The mug felt good against her--she could tell her body wasn't doing a good job of regulating her temperature, a sure sign she wasn't sleeping enough.  The house was quiet around her and the noise of the door flying open caught her off guard--she normally would have noticed Io's footsteps.  She realized that she hadn't even known Io was out.  Still the behaviors were a bit strange--Io didn't usually act so careless with the door, and they laughed a bit at her when they noticed Lo sitting on the couch. 

"Hi".  Lo's statement wasn't far from a question, though she knew it was on her that she didn't know where they'd been. 

"Lo." Io stumbled over the shoes in the door and dropped [something]. 

Was Io...was something wrong? She put her tea mug down. "Are you....are you okay?"

Io just laughed, the sound a bit slurred and indistinct. Lo's heart beat faster--she wondered if they were sick or something.  There was no reason she could think of that Io would be acting like this.   

"Loooooo."  They stretched her name out in that way...that way they used to do when they would fight in high school.  Io knew that Lo hated it and she couldn't remember the last time it had happened. She suddenly knew what was happening, though she hadn't seen anybody drunk in her lifetime.  She remembered a scene from an old movie when someone came in drunk and it all matched: the clumsiness, the slurring.  And the cantankerousness. 

"Lo, little one.  How's your little project going?"

She didn't say anything and Io just got angrier.

"You know you're not going to get anywhere."

"Where did you even find alcohol?"

"Don't matter. We're going to win, you know."

"Who? What are you even talking about?"

"The Bad Guys. We're totally going to win.  It's not hard when you just want to let people be themselves."

Lo backed up into the coffee table--she felt her body fly into a fear response, her energy suddenly very high, her knees bent and her eyes unable to see details only broad strokes.  This had to be....it had to be a joke right? 

"Io. What are you saying?"

"Aw, I'm just fuckin' with you, Lo. Just fooling around." 

"Why would you say that?"

"I dunno, Lo." They barked a harsh laugh at her.  "Let's go to bed."

She looked at Io from the corner of her eye.  "Okay, let's."  She guided them to the bed and they laid down fully clothed. She pulled their shoes off, and pulled a blanket over them.  

Something was very, very wrong.  She couldn't believe that Io was one of the Bad Guys but nothing about this was normal.
