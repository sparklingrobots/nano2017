SUMMARY: Lo tests Jy (now Fi) on the way to unlocking the tree. 

Lo released the safety clasp on the hedge clippers she'd stolen from the Well. They'd been the best thing she could find to cut what she imagined the fence to be. 

The sky was a curious green she'd heard about from books but never seen herself.  The clouds were heavy and looked almost purple somehow.  Dawn was coming but it might not get bright for days given the cloud cover. 

The forest smelled so good.  She stopped for a minute and just sucked air in through her nose.  She had never smelled the forest this strong before--after the rain it was sometime stronger but this was like the plants themselves were calling out to her to make things right. 

She opened the jaws of the hedge clipper and began snipping wires on the chainlink fence, putting all her strength into it.  Where they'd even found this fence was beyond her--she'd seen old chain link fences, dull with age and wear, grown over by vines.  This fence was new, shiny and strong.

When the hole grew big enough for her to slip through, she dropped the clippers to the ground and climbed through, her pack catching on the sharp ends of the fence.  As she crossed inside, the hairs on her body rose.  She swore she felt them watching her. At the very least they were coming after her. Time was short. She grabbed the patch of fence and put it back where it came from--at a glance the fence seemed relatively intact and might slow them down. Not that it mattered all that much. If they found her, it would be too late, either for them or for her.  The middle ground had disappeared long ago.

She guessed the tree was about two miles away. As she pushed through the undergrowth of the forest, rain began falling, fat, cold drops splashing around her.  She pulled up the hood on her jacket and pushed on.  Wet ferns slid against her legs as she ducked under the low branches of old pines.  Progress was slow in the dark, illuminated occasionally by lightning.  She felt her way slowly, roots appearing underfoot with no warning.  The ground was becoming very slick with occasional spots of deep mud. Once she heard the hoot of an owl in a nearby tree. 

After an unknown length of time, the sun had still not come up.  Her eyes, grown accustomed to the shape of trees and undergrowth, opened wide with shock as she saw a great square silhouette in the forest. She had stumbled on a few buildings. Old apartment buildings, by the looks of them, faded into almost colorlessness, some covered in giant bougainvilleas or star jasmines (probably need new plants), but mostly mottled with lichens and moss.  Sliding glass doors stared at her, the dark rooms inside impossible to see into

She looked around for a dry spot under a tree and closed her eyes. She brought the image of the map to her eyes. Was this the right place? She'd had no idea there were old ruins so close to the spring.  She took some deep breaths and studied her memory of the place.  

She jumped as she heard a familiar whistle in front of her and to her right.  That was Fi's call. Anyone might have thought the sound a bird, except the forest was dead quiet under the droning wash of rain.  Hope swelled inside her to hear that familiar call now and she wanted to run to it, to hug Fi and to apologize for everything.   [The last time she saw Fi, Fi was being dragged off by the Bad Delvers but Lo had not returned to save her.]

She followed, creeping quietly through the bushes towards the noise.  The whistle sounded again, closer this time.  She crouched against the trunk of a tree, scanning through the rain and undergrowth for a glimpse of her friend.  She realized she needed to be ready to fight if Fi had turned. She caught a glimpse of a hooded figure moving out of cover next to a building, moving slowly through the wet plants.  She heard the call again--it was Fi. Lo responded with the same call.
