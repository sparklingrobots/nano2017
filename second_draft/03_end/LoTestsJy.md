SUMMARY: Lo tests Jy on the way to unlocking the tree. 

Lo pulled the hedge clippers out of her bag and released the safety clasp. 

The sky was a curious green she'd heard about from books but never seen herself.  The clouds were heavy and looked almost purple somehow.  

The forest smelled so good.  She stopped for a minute and just sucked air in through her nose.  She had never smelled it this strong before--after the rain it was sometime stronger but this was like the plants themselves were calling out to her to be there to make things right. 

She resumed clipping the wires on the chainlink fence.  Where they'd even found this fence was beyond her--she'd seen it around but it was always ancient and this was new, almost shiny. 

She cut a small hole big enough for her to slip through (though her pack caught on the wires).  As she crossed the barrier she felt the hairs on her body rise, almost as if she had crossed some other kind of boundary.  She felt them watching her. 

She put the wire back in the hole, which seemed incredibly dumb but at a glance it seemed...relatively intact. 

It didn't much matter anyhow. If and/or when they found her, it would be too late, either for them or for her.  

She pushed through the undergrowth of the forest, making a path where there wasn't any.  The tree was about two miles away and although there was plenty of undergrowth there were also buildings and other human-made things kept inside the fence. 

She walked past old apartment buildings, faded into almost colorlessness, some covered in giant bougainvilleas or star jasmines, but mostly they were naked in the darkening air.  She didn't like these uninhabited parts of town and always felt like someone was around who she couldn't see. 

It wasn't totally wrong. She jumped as she heard a familiar whistle from her right.  She looked around, crouching to hide herself in case Jy had turned.  

God, she really couldn't handle it.  She needed all of them.  They all had to survive this together or not at all.  She shook her head--it was a ridiculous thought but it wouldn't leave her alone. 

She crept through the bushes and the whistle sounded again.  She saw Jy move out of cover next to a building and she looked for a long time. 

With Io there had been no sign.  She looked closely at Jy.  They seemed nervous.  They seemed scared.  And then she realized it didn't matter: Without Jy they couldn't sing the song.  They couldn't complete the Action and without the Action they were lost. 

She responded with her own signature whistle and stood up a half foot. Jy whipped around to look for her and smiled when they saw her.  Her legs swung through the brush as she ran, still crouching, to Jy's side.  

They hugged. Jy whispered, "I didn't know if I'd make it through."

Lo didn't say anything. 

She clapped her hands on Jy's shoulders. "Alright, little Jy. Let's find the others and get this done."  They turned back toward the south, knowing the tree was there and they set off.
