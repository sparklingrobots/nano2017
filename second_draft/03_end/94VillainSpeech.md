Summary: Villain speech.

"What I'm really trying to say to you, Lo, is that the thing you're looking for isn't here.  There is no magical answer, there is no way through.  

You know the XXXX (device) will get you what you want.  You know where it is and how to use it.  And yet here you sit, sanctimonious and alone."

Lo did feel very alone.  Maybe more alone than she had ever felt.  In this dark, metal place, this cold, loud clanging place, she didn't know if there was anyone else in this world, even though she could remember walking through the door. She could remember the feel of the pine needles under foot, the wind carrying the smell of the lake to her, as far as she *knew* everyone was still out there, being themselves, doing the work they were working on together, and yet she felt desperately alone here. 

They regarded her with those beautiful eyes.  In another place, in another time, with another world around them, perhaps they would have been lovers. But in this place and time they were not.  She couldn't even regard them as an enemy, but that word was as close as she could get--it was an intimate malice and she was terrified.


[stuff happens]

She realized that she was not, in fact, alone. Io was here with her.  Io with their malice and their desperation and their bizarre institutional backing and whatever their long goal was, Io was here with her in this metal place.

She laughed. 

Io ignored her, continuing to cook. 

She had her way out, now.  And Io would never be the same.
