#TODO: FLIGHT FROM THE WELL. FINDING ALL THE WOUNDED DELVERS. 

As Lo runs down the hall, blind to where she is going, she realizes she is crying. 


This hallway is totally new to Lo. Here every last detail is hexagonal--the shape of the hallway, the doorways, door knobs, everything. The ceiling, walls and floor are all a highly polished, warm wood--it is a tunnel more than a hallway.  She wipes her face as she sees a Delver running at top speed toward her. Will she have to fight them? She steadies herself for a confrontation but they simply sprint past her toward the library, concern on their face.  

At the end of the hallway, Lo can see a large room.  She slows as she approaches the room--this part of the Well is all new and it's possible the people in there will be less excited about Lo's appearance than the last person. She doesn't feel any Delving and using her own rudimentary senses, she detects almost nothing in the room.  She can tell there are people there, but...perhaps they are asleep? 

She steps up to the opening and looks around.  The enormous chamber, domed, must reach to the ceiling of the Well--there is a bright but diffuse light that must be sunlight. The room is almost humid, and smells of growth. Plants climb everywhere--banana trees, fig trees, palms and bromeliads--a veritable hot house.  The smell was incredible.  The room soothed Lo in some way, felt designed to hold her, to love her.  A small fountain splashed into a pond in the middle of the room, covered in lily ponds. 

Lo stood, nearly entranced, in the doorway, until she heard a feeble noise off to her right. Along one of the twisting paths, she found a Delver sprawled on the sidewalk.
