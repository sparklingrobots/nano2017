SUMMARY: Lo thinks about trees. 

Lo felt the bark of the tree against her back as she woke up.  The day was clear and lovely.  She was glad for the tree and glad for the sky around her as well . She could hear the others cooking breakfast already. The smell of mushrooms cooking drew her closer to them. 

She wanted to admit something to them but couldn't quite put her finger on it. There was something bothering her. She felt guilty a lot but couldn't understnand why or what made her feel that way.   

This tree is very old. 

She wonders if this tree lived through the Great Mourning. 

Something no one regrets: Planting the right tree.

She regarded the old tree, not for the first time.  She closed her eyes and felt the roots as they grew out from the small tree into the massive tree it is today.  The branches were not round but were buttressed, like wings out from the trunk.  Knots larger than her head protruded from the trunk, like knuckles on an old human hand.  The roots extended and extended and extended---a  good fifteen feet away you could still find yourself tripping on them. 

The branches were full, the tree was strong.
