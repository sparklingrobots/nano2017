SUMMARY: Delver leaders debate about bringing Lo into the mission. Lo's history is unveiled a bit. 



Un, Zo and Mq sat in a small room of the Well together.  Fi was there, too, off to the side.  Un would have to sort out what to do with Fi and the other damaged ones--they made the Delvers uncomfortable and that kind of tension would not be good for the community as a whole.  But they couldn't simply eject Fi, either.  Bad for morale. 

Zo cleared their throat, "You called us here to talk about the situation?"

Un nodded. "There are many things going on.  First, we have our damaged Delvers here." Zo glanced unintentionally at Fi and saw them cringe away from the attention. "Second, we need to remove the threat of the tree. And third, we need to figure out if this has anything to do with the greater problems with Delvers in the region."

"We obviously can't send any more Delvers, not after the way the last one came back," Mq responded gruffly. 

"I have some ideas about the second one," Zo started. Zo's role as community organizer [need a better title] meant she knew a lot about the area and the people who lived there. "There's a woman named Lo who writes books about the area--she's knowledgeable and well connected. If anyone is going to know something special about that tree, she is where I'd start."

"She's not a Delver--she's just another person. I've only met her once or twice, but I reviewed her book on the area before she published it and found her quite insightful."

"What's her full name?" Mq asked. Mq's specialty as a delver was to test new born babies to see if they would be a good fit for the Delvers. It had been quite a while since Mq had done the tests themselves--now a gray-haired and rugged faced person, Mq was responsible for training and overseeing the corps of Finders. They pulled up their book of names. 

"Lo Ana Iquy."

Mq began flipping through the book, cross-referencing their enormous storage cavern's organizational scheme. "Fi, fetch me this file, if you would." Mq scrawled a ten digit number on a note card and passed it over. 

"In the mean time, I have reports of more Delvers going missing. We haven't lost any here but there seems to be a handful of Wells suffering from missing Delvers and....other disturbing incidents."

"You think it's related?"

#todo: New scenes from Delver Leadership perspective. 

"The timing is incredibly suspicious. I've sent envoys to each Well reporting missing Delvers to tell them what we experienced. I don't trust it by mail."

[stuff happens, or maybe the file is brought in with them]

Fi returned with the file, put it on the table and returned to their seat on the side of the room. 

Mq opened the file and started scanning. Un could see something interesting was presenting itself by the way Mq's eyes opened slightly.  

"I don't think she's a good choice." Mq said, still lost in the file. 

Un arched an eyebrow and waited.  

"She has...a strange history.  We tested her as a baby and I thought at first she would be perfect for us.  She's got a strong voice and memory for the songs, but there's something about her...we brought her here and although she was very well behaved, there was something...off.  The nursery was disrupted the entire time she was here. She had a lot of power for both unification and disruption but we couldn't get her to work for us. We had to send her home."

"They found her singing strange songs, even in the crib." A long pause.  "She liked to sing songs like the old songs, songs where she was the soloist, if you will." Un almost had forgotten the word. "The other babies would sing along with her but the nurses found it...discomfiting.  They felt like she was exerting a strange power over the other children."

"Is that all? It hardly seems enough to say no in this case."

"Another Delver had a vision about her.  They awoke from it in a fit, screaming 'Beware the King of All Birds'. And when they calmed down they described her perfectly-they said a person named Lo had risen to destroy the Delvers, that she would be the end of us." Mq paused at length.  "It was Gi who had the vision."

The three of them sat in silence.

"Let's send her." Though they weren't a hierarchical organization, Un spoke with the kind of authority only earned by long and hard service, smart ideas and a good eye for the Wells. The other two didn't respond at first, until Zo turned to Fi. 

"Get her for us."
