SUMMARY: The campsite (chapter one)

Lo's hands were tired from scrubbing the silk out of the corn they'd brought. Two big pots of water boiled over the fire, ready for the massive heap of fresh summer corn she'd been preparing.  She pulled the silks from the last ear and tossed it on the platter next to her.  "Finished," she called over her shoulder, hands picking the stray white threads from her hands as she stood up. 

Su came over and grabbed the platters, then tipped them carefully into the pot.  Lo watched, smelling the smoke of the dozen fires around them, food cooking and bubbling away in preparation for tonight's potluck.  

Su standing by the fire, big empty plate down at her side, trigged memories of the last harvest.  Lo hadn't even known Su back then, not well, anyway, but the smell, the murmuring of everyone out in the forests--it all reminded her of then. Her parents were still alive, she'd been around 12 and soooo booooored by the whole thing. 

A passing neighbor waved as they walked by. Even with so many people, so many cook fires, the forest still smelt incredibly fresh.  And the animals didn't seem to mind either--across a meadow, Lo watched a crow snuffling around for scraps from the neighbor's prep area. It stopped picking at whatever it found on the ground and looked back at her.  She waved and the bird went back to eating. 

Dinner would be soon, after the Delvers finished their rituals under the tree.  She could see the tents spread out through the forest, canvas perched under the trees. She supposed it wasn't so different from the migration of some massive animal herd.  

Tomorrow they would harvest the bubbleweed that grew in the shadow of the trees--the harvest that only came every seven years or so. The abundance would last them the next seven years, though--dried bubbleweed used in teas and tinctures, though most of it went to the Delvers for their work. (Do I need to just always write more than I do? Is there anything to this scene other than setting the scene? Should there be at least a minor desire to carry us forward? Is it too much to be like LO RESENTS THIS)

[Might be a good idea to give Lo something to be excited about that will be wrecked by the murder.]

It's not my fault we brought so much corn, and here I am anyway, pulling silks off for the better part of two hours. I swear I've never seen so much corn, but I guess this is what you gotta do when you're having a town-size potluck.  Su
