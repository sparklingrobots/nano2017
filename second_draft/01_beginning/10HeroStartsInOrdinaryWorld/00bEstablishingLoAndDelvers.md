00bEstablishing more about Lo & Delvers

We need a scene where Lo goes to the local Delver for something. We want to establish Delvers as a positive and trusted force, and also this way we can settle whatever it is Lo wants before things go to absolute shit. 

---

The town is bustling, everyone is busy preparing for the seven-year harvest. Lo is not really concerned about the harvest because she's worried about something else. She wants to know, perhaps, if she'll be chosen to raise children.  Or maybe something else. I need to figure out who exactly Lo is. Big surprise there. 

Actually I think Lo works for the Delvers in some way--she's not super close but maybe she cooks for them or does something else. She basically has a one-on-one with somebody every week to check in on her progress for them.  What would they need her to do for them? 

They keep her close because of her history, though she doesn't know that.  Maybe it's a job interview? Nah, too complicated.  

We need to establish Lo as a serious creature of habit, too.

 I feel majorly overwhelmed by the task ahead of me, which is just to write a super boring scene that establishes some of Lo's every day normal problems that get swept away when the novel actually starts.  I have this deep aversion to knowing what Lo does, what her life is like outside of the Well.

It's hard to remember now, what it was like before.  I feel I've been living in the Well all my life, among the Delvers but not of them, locked up in this library, visited by Finelle every afternoon.  The world before fades. This is where I've always wanted to be and if I had my way, there never would have been that life.  But since you asked, since you think it's important, here was a regular day for me: 



I woke up before dawn most days, not sure why. No alarm.  I made a cup of coffee in my French press (wonder why they call it that?) most mornings, sat out on my balcony and looked out at the edge of town, and the forest beyond.  Most days the weather was temperate, we didn't see a lot of snow or anything, just cool breezes and sunny days or rain.  



On work days I ..



Her job either should be about change or be the opposite of change.  The struggle I'm having now is this: What is the economy of this place? Should I just ignore this? It feels pretty important to know how we all say both clothed and fed AND how we stay fulfilled and happy and stuff. Is it different or not? If she has a dreary job she doesn't like, is that the right world I'm trying to draw? Is this a more volunteer economy supported by the Delvers and by Nature? e.g. a sorta advanced Hunter/Gatherer or agricultural society.  Or do they have jobs making things. Also the job can depend on how many people live in the town. How much work is needed to support the town. In my mind it's small, like under 100 people small, but that seems a bit silly.  Why would it be so small? Maybe because the Delver work is very hard to scale so they keep the population low. 

Still if they have a low population generally, how is it they aren't overrun? I feel like the border is essentially psychically protected. The Delvers can also conscript Non-Delvers into attacks against their will, though it hasn't been done in memory.  There is also something of mind-control to their general practices. They act as if peace is the thing but secretly they are preparing the people to fight if needed. 

If this is true, then how/why did the villages fall? Maybe they were out of practice.  So after that starts happening and after the murder the Delvers have a LOT of singing practice all of a sudden. 

So the population is low, possible jobs are: Fisher, hunter, farmer, gatherer, doctor, nurse, teacher, Delver, delver helper, cleaner, parks keeper, mechanic, plumber, water plant employee, trash collector, engineer who keeps the roads such as they are, baker, chef, other. I don't know. They all feel so basic. There must be other interesting jobs. General repair person (fixes things in houses, watches, whatever). Bicycle mechanic.
