SUMMARY: What happens the morning of the murder. 

A strange piercing bird call woke him up early that morning.  He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and got dressed.  He belted the long robe and got up. It was just as well that the damn bird had woken him up; as junior member of the morning ceremony it was his job to prepare the ceremony so Mq and Un could just roll out of bed and get all the credit. 

He took a deep breath and steading himself.  The ceremony was important. He was happy to be here. Jealousy didn't become a Delver and besides, he'd be reprimanded for being out of control if he met anybody else at that hour. He slipped on the tiny reflective lenses they all wore, and his feet found the slippers outside his tent. 

Helpful Redshirt #1 wasn't up yet, but he walked quietly towards the old tree to get started.  A small bundle made of a rough hewn red fabric rested on the edge of camp. When he picked it up, the tools of the ceremony clanked--knives and OTHER THINGS--and he flinched. 

As he entered the drooping branches of the old willow, he felt that old magic he associated most strongly with the Delvers and his first entry as a child.  The long dangling green growth, catkins or whatever ripe in the early summer, brushed his face as he moved in.  The spring was utterly silent, though the soft rippling on the surface gave it away as more than just a pool.  The pale sand at the bottom moved constantly where the water bubbled up endlessly from the earth--pure like nothing else in the world, cold and clear. 

He got to the base of the tree and dropped the bundle, far enough now that it was likely no one would hear. He stiffened as the clatter seemed to silence all the birds that had begun singing. After a heartbeat they resumed their songs and he resumed his work. 

As he set up the ring around the tree and the spring, he passed near the tree.  He noticed a streak running down the trunk--he'd never seen anything like that on the tree before, though he was hardly a botanist. He ignored it and went back to work driving the stakes into the ground to delineate the sacred area from the vulgar--mostly so none of the non-Delvers would find their way into the sacred bit.  

The streak remained in his mind, bothering him. Was the tree okay? He put down the remaining sticks and went back up to the tree, closer this time. It looked like sap--he reached out to it and felt the sticky substance hardening along the side of the tree. Pressing his fingers together, he felt the stickiness pulling at his skin.
