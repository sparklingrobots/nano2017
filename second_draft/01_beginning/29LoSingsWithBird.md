SUMMARY: Lo sings with a bird. 

Because I knew you I have been changed for good. 

That was the phrase that kept pestering her.  She had seen it on some street art--a small and beautifully rendered sentence in the midst of a profusion of flowers and skulls mixed together.  She should keep her eyes open for street art. 

As she walked home from the market she was lost in thought, scanning teh ground as she worked on the words of the song. She didn't notice the person coming the other direction until they bumped into each other.  She flushed and apologized immediately, though the other person, a very pale person with light hair, didn't say anything, just looked at her reproachfully.  

She tried not to let it irritate her but found it kept coming back to her, almost unnaturally.  Maybe she needed to get some more sleep, or drink some more water or something.  She sat on the nearest bench and put her food down.  She needed to just take a breath.  

She put her head down and realized there was writing on the bench, right where she was sitting.  It looked like someone had taken a permanent marker and decided the bench was the right place to leave a note.  Not a slogan, but an outright paragraph.

"If you don't join us, you'll regret it.  The Delvers are here to control us.  You've always known something was wrong about them, but you refuse to see it for what it is.  You're a bitch and you've always been a bitch.  Join us or don't.  We'll be just fine either way.  [needs more detail and length and personal vitriol.]"

Lo read it several times over.  She'd never seen anything like it. Had it been left for her?  She felt silly for thinking it but something about the note seemed very, very personal. She wondered about the person she'd bumped into.  The note had a similar dark feeling to it, a brooding rage.

Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.

What I really mean to say is what kind of broken world do we live in that someone would leave a note like that for someone else at all? That they would defile a public bench to do it? What kind of world is it that we wake up in every day? 

A bird landed on the sidewalk in front of her.  It looked at her, made eye contact or so it seemed. And it opened it's mouth and sang a little snippet of the song.  

She was nearly as startled by that as by the note on the bench.  Was the bird really looking at her? Really trying to sing the same song?  Perhaps she'd heard the song before and incorporated it unknowingly into her own work. 

Or maybe this bird song had always been important. Maybe the original singers had copied this bird.  What kind of bird was it? 

The bird looked bored as she stared at it.  It cocked its head to one side and hopped closer. It was a beautiful bird--very small, small enough it could stand on her hand if it wanted to.  Brown with blue feathers on its head and the edges of its wings. It sang the line again. 

This time she sang the next line back at it.  The bird hopped a few times, excited, or as near to excited as she could tell from a bird.  She sang the line the bird sang and it joined her for both the lines.  She felt her mouth open in wonder.  She started the third line, the one she wasn't sure about, and the bird sang with her, though they diverged--and then the bird flew away.  She felt disappointment wash over her and then she realized someone was walking down the path towards the market, shoes slapping the red brick path.  
	
Well, it was a clue, in any case. 


THIS BIRD EXPERIENCE IS THE THING THAT MAKES HER ACCEPT THE CALL TO GO TO THE WELL
