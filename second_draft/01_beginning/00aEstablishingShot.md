The sound, powerful and warm, ancient as the building they stood in and honed over the centuries to do its job better than any other, filled every inch of the space, rumbling and rattling in the materials of the building itself, leaking out through colored glass panes and gaps between doors and doorframes, pushing directly out through the walls themselves, escaping into the fresh air diminished and muddy but still strong, absorbing sunlight and riding the breeze a few extra feet, dying finally on the green grass outside, falling on the rosebushes and the sidewalk like a gentle rain. 

The sound was built of hundreds of voices, layered, unified, glorious; created by the lungs and lips and larynxes of all the people inside the building, tongues and teeth shaping, blood pounding, weight swaying between one foot and the other, sound they had practiced their entire lives, a great blending that erased the edge of any given voice into one big cannon of sound, one big flood unleashed in vibrations made visible on the surface of water glasses. 

A squirrel scampered across the park outside, headed for the oak that shaded the old building. The song, much diminished and distorted by the extremely poor transmissive qualities of the building, embraced the squirrel. Tail twitching, it turned its little grey face toward the building, listening so closely that it didn't hear the cat as it snuck around the corner of the building, claws sinking into its tender throat. 

The cat, a big silver tabby, held the squirrel down with a white paw and opened the squirrel's throat with its teeth, warm blood spilling into the grass. The squirrel struggled only briefly, and as soon as it stopped, the cat bit the limp body and dragged it under a nearby bush, to feast in private.  

When the song, as indeed this flood of sound was a _song_, came to an end, the last bits of power reverberated for a moment until only the sound of the wind and a quiet smacking noise from the cat eating remained.

Inside the building, concentric circles of people faced the center of the repurposed church, where seven other people faced out towards the crowd.  The vast majority of people in the room wore average clothes, jeans, t-shirts, sweaters.  The seven facing them wore identical black robes trimmed in yellow.  

The people on the outside took deep breaths, cleared their throats, drank water, shuffled awkwardly as they recovered from the singing. Fingers touched the corners of eyes as tears were wiped away. Eyeglasses were pulled off of faces to be cleaned on the edge of shirts. No one spoke.  The robed figures each pulled a pair of glasses from various places in their robes and slipped them on--the dark mirrored lenses hexagonal, just the size of their eyes. 

A woman in the middle of the crowd, not so different from any of hundreds of others in the outer rings, pulled her red cardigan tight around her body.  She caught the eye of one of the Delvers at the center of the circle and looked away, up at the colored glass windows.  

She felt a hand on her back, turned and saw Saskia there, a glass of water offered steadily to Lo. Lo cleared her throat and took the glass from Saskia with a silent smile.  Saskia left her hand there as Lo drank. 

I NEED AN END TO THIS SCENE -- LITERALLY ONE MORE PARAGRAPH/SENTENCE/THOUGHT COULD GET US THERE.
