Summary: Lo's Musical Life

 
Her music studies were going well, she thought to herself.  Not everyone would have been able to learn all these songs the way she had, mostly out of books and going to weird events where other music nerds would gather. 

She toyed with her dinner, a particular song stuck in her head: 

_Needing is one thing, and getting /
getting's another_

It was an old song.  It was from before and had nothing to do with anything else, but it's stuck in our writer's head and feels relevant. 

She had been specializing in the songs of extinction, lately.  There was an older person in town who got together with people once a month to sing those songs, songs of rage and fear and loss about the last elm tree, about the lost stripes of the tiger, about all the dead koalas.  The deeper you went the more you got into small creatures: The disappearance of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow, the battles against the zebra mussels and lion fish as they devoured ecosystems whole.  Bananas actually had an entire subgenre about them--songs about identical creatures being identically vulnerable, about banana splits.  One about the old joke about banana peels being slippery made her laugh particularly hard.

The building rose up above the others around it--not massive, but noticeably large.  The white roof capped a wall of colorful glass tiles, small squares of red, yellow, white, green, and so many blues that at a distance it mostly looked like the sky.  Large windows, placed irregularly in the north facing wall, watched Lo as she walked up to the familiar building. It was bigger than any other building in town, save a few of the larger apartment buildings. She could smell sesame oil and onions cooking somewhere near by. 

Warm air rushed over her as she entered the old church, drying her eyes enough to make her blink. Light came in, multi-colored and warm from the old stained glass.  The building was ancient, built in the middle 1900s, they said.  The windows were abstract, jagged slabs of colored glass high on the wall.  

Ahead of her, the small group had already started singing.  She slipped in, late as usual, pulling up a chair just outside of the main circle. She'd missed the last three weeks and they'd forgotten to leave a chair for her. She opened her mouth, singing along with them. A Delver--Ls, she thought--was preparing some tea off to the side while the rest of them sang. She liked to arrive late so there wasn't much time for talking in advance.  Even so, she could feel that strange plucking feeling inside her, the sign that a Delver was investigating her, looking for information.  She ignored it as best she could, letting the movement of air from her lungs be shaped by her mouth, letting that rush empty her of the worries she'd been carrying. 

For the next hour they sang together, with breaks for warm tea.  If anyone had bothered to look in, they'd have thought Lo just another member of the group.  The Delvers controlled the songs, most of which they knew by now.  Some were sung only during certain times of year.  

This week they had a new song. Lo recalled it, vaguely, but they had to go over the words together and practice a few times.  The harmonies were easy, each person slotting into the role they'd been singing since adolescence. 

Lo felt a wave of tears, unexpected, as they hit the bridge of the song.  The anxiety and worry she'd been carrying since the harvest seemed to amplify into terror, a quivering vein of emotion brought to the surface. She could see Ls watching her, but not Delving her.  Lo decided not to act in either direction. The Delvers had certainly delved the group as people arrived, had picked this song for a reason--she tried not to act suspicious. She was waiting, somehow, still for the news to be shared, for the community to come together and learn from the terrible things that had happened.  

From the corner of her eye she saw her neighbor's hand come up to her face. So she wasn't alone.  


At the church, they sang together.  They couldn't bring books or written versions of the songs from the library to the church, so when she found a new one at the library she was compelled to learn it herself, singing it over and over at home and on her bike until she could bring it to them.  Ml knew a lot of the songs and could help her when she fumbled. 

It was lovely, really, the singing of these songs together.  The churches were so resonant, absolutely the right place for singing of any kind, and the light streamed in on them.  Many weeks they wept together at the end.  


At the end of the recent session, as Lo sat and dried her face, Ml said to them: "This is why we sing.  We can't forget the pain.  And the music carries it to us, fresh as the day it was born. And we also have to remember how we handle the pain matters.  It matters to let it flow through us. The pain will always win if we don't let it flow."

She nodded. Her shoulders slumped and she felt tired.  The group of singers had gathered around her in silence, as they always did when someone was suffering extra. 

It was wise.  But it was hard.
