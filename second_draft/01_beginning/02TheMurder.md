A cry broke the stillness of the morning, long and plaintive, rising from a bird somewhere off in the forest. It woke Lo up. Su remained still, breathing undisturbed by the shriek.  It was almost like no one else had heard it.  She dressed quietly and headed out into the forest looking for kindling and fire material. A pine tree loomed ahead, enormous--maybe as old as the sacred willow. Well, nearly as old in any case. The pine cones would start the breakfast fire quickly so they wouldn't be late for the morning ceremoney. 

At the foot of the pine, she spied a pile of pinecones and squatted to gather them, pine needles coming along for the ride, and turned to walk back through the forest.  Cool, almost cold, night breezes had dispersed the strong smell of wood smoke, and the smell and shimmer of dew in the pre-dawn light gave her the shivers somehow.  

She dropped off her load of kindling and turned back to her task of finding larger pieces of wood.  Her eyes scanned the forest floor, but with so many people in the forest, she found mostly trampled greenery and guylines for the tents. Last night's supper fires must have depleted the fallen wood closest to the sleeping area.  She crossed a small stream, picking her footing carefully, and then traversed the meadow full of tents to get to the edge of the encampment.  Lo smiled at the sound of sleeping humans, peaceful and starting to shift as the light grew. 

She somehow grows distracted and realizes she's come near the restricted area around the spring.  She spies the 

The Delvers are holding a secret ritual, which they always do.  Something goes wrong and 
Suddenly a loud scream--a body is discovered.  Over the prone body -- a Delver -- is another Delver, stunned by their own actions but holding a bloody knife.  (Actually they might just kill each other.)

Lo finds the bodies and stumbles off before anyone can know she's there. (possibly this is the start of chapter 2--Lo rejecting the call, pretending nothing happened, wondering when the news will get out)



Lo Ponders Trees: 
Lo felt the bark of the tree against her back as she woke up.  The day was clear and lovely.  She was glad for the tree and glad for the sky around her as well . She could hear the others cooking breakfast already. The smell of mushrooms cooking drew her closer to them. 

She wanted to admit something to them but couldn't quite put her finger on it. There was something bothering her. She felt guilty a lot but couldn't understnand why or what made her feel that way.   

This tree is very old. 

She wonders if this tree lived through the Great Mourning. 

Something no one regrets: Planting the right tree. 

---

She regarded the old tree, not for the first time.  She closed her eyes and felt the roots as they grew out from the small tree into the massive tree it is today.  The branches were not round but were buttressed, like wings out from the trunk.  Knots larger than her head protruded from the trunk, like knuckles on an old human hand.  The roots extended and extended and extended---a  good fifteen feet away you could still find yourself tripping on them. 

The branches were full, the tree was strong. 


Notes:

This happens at the spring and something in the tree triggers it.  E.g. the dead Delver (or maybe both of them) accidentally ate some sap from the holy tree. Perhaps one of them is just investigating it --one of the plant Delvers like Lo -- and it breaks them.  The year's harvest is tainted and that's why people start getting loopy. 

The plant is perhaps what gives everyone their super powers of stability. Or perhaps it's just the thing that gives Delvers their powers, or something like that.  

They can't live *without* the powers,  but the corrupted powers are no good.  Lo needs to share the knowledge of the cure among everyone, which is transmitted via song. 

IT'S COOL, JUST REWRITING DUNE ALL OF A SUDDEN NBD. 

This is a great opportunity to introduce the harmonious community, and a few characters.  Think of this as the prelude an episode of the X-Files.
