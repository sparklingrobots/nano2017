00bEstablishing more about Lo & Delvers

We need a scene where Lo goes to the local Delver for something. We want to establish Delvers as a positive and trusted force, and also this way we can settle whatever it is Lo wants before things go to absolute shit. 

---

The town is bustling, everyone is busy preparing for the seven-year harvest. Lo is not really concerned about the harvest because she's worried about something else. She wants to know, perhaps, if she'll be chosen to raise children.  Or maybe something else. I need to figure out who exactly Lo is. Big surprise there. 

Actually I think Lo works for the Delvers in some way--she's not super close but maybe she cooks for them or does something else. She basically has a one-on-one with somebody every week to check in on her progress for them.  What would they need her to do for them? 

They keep her close because of her history, though she doesn't know that.  Maybe it's a job interview? Nah, too complicated.  

We need to establish Lo as a serious creature of habit, too.
