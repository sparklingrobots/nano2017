The sound, powerful and warm, ancient as the building they stood in and honed over the centuries to do its job better than any other, filled every inch of the space, rumbling and rattling in the materials of the building itself, leaking out through colored glass panes and gaps between doors and doorframes, pushing directly out through the walls themselves, escaping into the fresh air diminished and muddy but still strong, absorbing sunlight and riding the breeze a few extra feet, dying finally on the green grass outside, falling on the rosebushes and the sidewalk like a gentle rain. 

A squirrel scampered across the park, headed for the oak that shaded the old building. The song, much diminished and distorted by the extremely poor transmissive qualities of the building, embraced the squirrel. Tail twitching, it turned its little grey face toward the building, listening so closely that it didn't hear the cat as it snuck around the corner of the building, claws sinking into its tender throat. 

The cat, a big silver tabby, held the squirrel down with a white paw and opened the squirrel's throat with its teeth, warm blood spilling into the grass. The squirrel struggled only briefly, and as soon as it stopped, the cat bit the limp body and dragged it under the bush where it lived, to feast in private. 

Silence as the song came to an end. The humans inside the building cleared their throats, drank water, shuffled awkwardly.
