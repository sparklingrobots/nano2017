SUMMARY: Intro through the inciting incident (chapter one)

All are out at the harvesting site of the sacred tree. It's time for the every-seven-years harvest of bubbleweed and everyone has come out into the country side for it. 

It's a joyous time--regular responsibilities are cast aside, tents are set up, fires are built.  The whole community is excited -- this year's harvest is supposed to be enormous and it's been a lean year.  

The Delvers are holding a secret ritual, which they always do.  Something goes wrong and 
Suddenly a loud scream--a body is discovered.  Over the prone body -- a Delver -- is another Delver, stunned by their own actions but holding a bloody knife.  (Actually they might just kill each other.)

Lo finds the bodies and stumbles off before anyone can know she's there. (possibly this is the start of chapter 2--Lo rejecting the call, pretending nothing happened, wondering when the news will get out)


Notes:

This happens at the spring and something in the tree triggers it.  E.g. the dead Delver (or maybe both of them) accidentally ate some sap from the holy tree. Perhaps one of them is just investigating it --one of the plant Delvers like Lo -- and it breaks them.  The year's harvest is tainted and that's why people start getting loopy. 

The plant is perhaps what gives everyone their super powers of stability. Or perhaps it's just the thing that gives Delvers their powers, or something like that.  

They can't live *without* the powers,  but the corrupted powers are no good.  Lo needs to share the knowledge of the cure among everyone, which is transmitted via song. 

IT'S COOL, JUST REWRITING DUNE ALL OF A SUDDEN NBD. 

This is a great opportunity to introduce the harmonious community, and a few characters.  Think of this as the prelude an episode of the X-Files.
