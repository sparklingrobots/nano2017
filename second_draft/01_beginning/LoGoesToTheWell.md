SUMMARY: Lo arrives at the Well. 

#todo: consider the scene at the end from Un's perspective instead of Lo's

Lo grabbed her bag from the rack on the back of her bike and nodded to Fi.  The ride had been about three hours and her legs were a bit tired and stiff, but not bad. The nearest well was in an old church, as many of them were.  It was beautiful, really, and very large.  She'd never been inside one of the Wells.  The experience was overwhelming.  

This Well was beautiful to Lo. Her reservations and fear melted away as they drew closer.  There were a few rings around the Well itself, a sort of labyrinth of entrance, not hedged but merely manicured.  Large dried hydrangea globes bobbed in the breeze. An inner circle of maples were lit in full orange.  After the long ride she started to feel refreshed.  It seemed cooler and cleaner here than anywhere else she had been.  

The building itself was hexagonal, with large windows.  As they pedaled toward the center, Lo was sure they were being examined in one way or another, though she couldn't see anyone who paid them much mind.  A few delvers were replacing some dead daffodils with pansies.  

As she fussed with the clips on her backpack, a tall person stepped out of the front door and greeted them both. 

"Fi, good to see you. Lo, thank you for travelling with Fi to get here.  Let's go inside and I will get you something to eat and drink."  Lo nodded appreciatively.  She could feel a narcotic effect setting in--her mind seemed clear but she was strugging to find anything to worry about. 

As they entered the building, they walked down a long hallway that seemed to bisect the building.  The floor was smooth stone, and the hall was low-ceilinged and dark--lit mostly from light that flooded in through the windowed doors at either end.  They reached the far side and took a right, following the outside of the building with the glass exterior on their left.  They entered a small room. 

The taller one started making tea and gestured at two chairs in this strange windowless hexagonal room.  "Make yourselves comfortable.  Let me know if you need anything--there's a bell by the door." They pointed at a small plastic button on the wall--it looked positively ancient to Lo. In general the room seemed like something from a historical exhibit--the thick orange carpet, wood paneling on the walls.  She thought it looked like a living room from before the Great Mourning era. The tables and side bar were all very low slung, sleek looking, but the fabrics were all heavily textured--velvets, linen, brocade, things she couldn't name.  A single plant hung from a crocheted holder. She wondered how it lived in here with no windows.  [Ed note: I feel like this is a picture perfect living room from the 60s.]

Then the tall one turned to hand each of them a teacup and saucer, then placed a small tray of ginger cookies on the center of the table and wordlessly left the room. 

Lo picked up the tea but didn't drink right away--she blew on it while waiting to see what Fi did.  Fi took the cup as well and drank a few sips immediately.  Lo figured it was probably fine and drank as well. She was thirsty after the ride.  A cookie would help, too.

She reached for a ginger snap and noticed Fi was nervous.  "How ya doing, Fi?" Lo tried to keep it light.  "You look a bit spooked."

"I've just...I haven't been in this part of the Well for a long time.  And never like this."

"When did you come here?"

"When I was younger, they wanted to train me as a server, before my expertise with plants became known. How do you feel?"

Lo swallowed the cookie.  She didn't know if anyone was listening and decided it was better not to confess much. "I'm alright--I feel very calm, really." She assumed that was intentional on the part of the Delvers. 

Fi nodded. "You know, I'm not sure when, but it's likely they'll turn that down for you at some point today.  But with new people we always--"

The door swung open.  Another Delver swept into the room.  They wore very small sunglasses with reflective lenses--glasses that were nearly the exact size of their eyeballs.  Their hair was very long and straight and swept over the top of their head and down their back, with no part. They wore a black silk shirt and form fitting gray pants--not the robes Lo had noticed on the other Delvers here at the well.  Their smile was almost embarrassed--one of those half-embarassed, sheepish smiles that means the giver isn't really embarrassed at all.  

"Lo, I'm Un. It's so nice to finally meet you."

Lo automatically reached out for a handshake and felt immensely comforted when Un's hand took hers and shook.  "Nice to meet you, Un."

"Fi, thank you for your service in this matter, you can go to the bunks and make a spot for Lo."  Fi rose and bowed a short bow, then left the room wordlessly.  

They sat together in this small living room, not speaking.  Lo was overtaken with a calmness and joy she couldn't explain in the moment.  Un was merely waiting. 

After a few moments, Un spoke.  Their voice was low and beautiful, almost a bit gravelly. 

"Lo, I brought you here to talk about what Fi saw. We need your help and we need you to know things that no one knows outside of the Delvers."

Lo nodded enthusiastically.  She felt so drawn to Un that she of course wanted to help out. 

"But you need to know things and make your own decisions.  I know it is very pleasant being here, so we need to give you some time to adjust."

Lo didn't really know what Un was talking about but nodded anyway. 

"I'm going to slowly turn down my connection with you.  You may feel a bit lonely as it happens, but it's just a matter of comparison, not actual loneliness.  We'll have you stay overnight to recover and then we'll talk more in the morning."

Lo frowned a bit but it passed quickly.  "Lo, can you tell me about your bike ride in?"

Lo began to chatter about the bike ride, with Un asking periodic questions.  This was a standard practice when humans had to be brought in for any reason--Un had been doing it for a very long time and was known to have a light tough.  Lo was fine at first, effervescent nearly.  Then as Un decreased the delving, Lo became slower and less talkative until she finally seemed nearly dejected. 

It all went like normal, but there was something else about it as well. 

Lo had transferred her feelings back to Un, in some ways.  Un hadn't felt a genuine resonance with someone outside the Delvers in a very long time--it was uncommon for non-Delver adults to be able to affect a Delver, especially one of Un's abilities.  Un filed this information away--they'd been told Lo was special but nothing more; maybe this had something to do with it. As Un felt Lo's emotions begin to crash, he discretely dropped a pill in her next cup of tea. She needed rest.
