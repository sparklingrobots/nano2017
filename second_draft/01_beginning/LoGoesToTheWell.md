SUMMARY: Lo arrives at the Well. 

#todo: consider the scene at the end from Un's perspective instead of Lo's

Lo grabbed her bag from the rack on the back of her bike and nodded to Fi.  The ride had been about three hours and her legs were a bit tired and stiff, but not bad. The nearest well was in an old church, as many of them were.  It was beautiful, really, and very large.  She'd never been inside one of the Wells.  The experience was overwhelming.  

This Well was beautiful to Lo. Her reservations and fear melted away as they drew closer.  There were a few rings around the Well itself, a sort of labyrinth of entrance, not hedged but merely manicured.  Large dried hydrangea globes bobbed in the breeze. An inner circle of maples were lit in full orange.  After the long ride she started to feel refreshed.  It seemed cooler and cleaner here than anywhere else she had been.  

The building itself was hexagonal, with large windows.  As they pedaled toward the center, Lo was sure they were being examined in one way or another, though she couldn't see anyone who paid them much mind.  A few delvers were replacing some dead daffodils with pansies.  

As she fussed with the clips on her backpack, a tall person stepped out of the front door and greeted them both. 

"Fi, good to see you. Lo, thank you for travelling with Fi to get here.  Let's go inside and I will get you something to eat and drink."  Lo nodded appreciatively.  She could feel a narcotic effect setting in--her mind seemed clear but she was strugging to find anything to worry about. 

As they entered the building, they walked down a long hallway that seemed to bisect the building.  The floor was smooth stone, and the hall was low-ceilinged and dark--lit mostly from light that flooded in through the windowed doors at either end.  They reached the far side and took a right, following the outside of the building with the glass exterior on their left.  They entered a small room. 

The taller one started making tea and gestured at two chairs in this strange windowless hexagonal room.  "Make yourselves comfortable.  Let me know if you need anything--there's a bell by the door." They pointed at a small plastic button on the wall--it looked positively ancient to Lo. In general the room seemed like something from a historical exhibit--the thick orange carpet, wood paneling on the walls.  She thought it looked like a living room from before the Great Mourning era. The tables and side bar were all very low slung, sleek looking, but the fabrics were all heavily textured--velvets, linen, brocade, things she couldn't name.  A single plant hung from a crocheted holder. She wondered how it lived in here with no windows.  [Ed note: I feel like this is a picture perfect living room from the 60s.]

Then the tall one turned to hand each of them a teacup and saucer, then placed a small tray of ginger cookies on the center of the table and wordlessly left the room. 

Lo picked up the tea but didn't drink right away--she blew on it while waiting to see what Fi did.  Fi took the cup as well and drank a few sips immediately.  Lo figured it was probably fine and drank as well. She was thirsty after the ride.  A cookie would help, too.

She reached for a ginger snap and noticed Fi was nervous.  "How ya doing, Fi?" Lo tried to keep it light.  "You look a bit spooked."

"I've just...I haven't been in this part of the Well for a long time.  And never like this."

"When did you come here?"

"When I was younger, they wanted to train me as a server, before my expertise with plants became known. How do you feel?"

Lo swallowed the cookie.  She didn't know if anyone was listening and decided it was better not to confess much. "I'm alright--I feel very calm, really." She assumed that was intentional on the part of the Delvers. 

Fi nodded. "You know, I'm not sure when, but it's likely they'll turn that down for you at some point today.  But with new people we always--"

The door swung open.  Another Delver swept into the room.  They wore very small sunglasses with reflective lenses--glasses that were nearly the exact size of their eyeballs.  Their hair was very long and straight and swept over the top of their head and down their back, with no part. They wore a black silk shirt and form fitting gray pants--not the robes Lo had noticed on the other Delvers here at the well.  Their smile was almost embarrassed--one of those half-embarassed, sheepish smiles that means the giver isn't really embarrassed at all.  

"Lo, I'm Un. It's so nice to finally meet you."

Lo automatically reached out for a handshake and felt immensely comforted when Un's hand took hers and shook.  "Nice to meet you, Un."

"Fi, thank you for your service in this matter, you can go to the bunks and make a spot for Lo."  Fi rose and bowed a short bow, then left the room wordlessly.  

They sat together in this small living room, not speaking.  Lo was overtaken with a calmness and joy she couldn't explain in the moment.  Un was merely waiting. 

After a few moments, Un spoke.  Their voice was low and beautiful, almost a bit gravelly. 

"Lo, I brought you here to talk about what Fi saw. We need your help and we need you to know things that no one knows outside of the Delvers."

Lo nodded enthusiastically.  She felt so drawn to Un that she of course wanted to help out. 

"But you need to know things and make your own decisions.  I know it is very pleasant being here, so we need to give you some time to adjust."

Lo didn't really know what Un was talking about but nodded anyway. 

"I'm going to slowly turn down my connection with you.  You may feel a bit lonely as it happens, but it's just a matter of comparison, not actual loneliness.  We'll have you stay overnight to recover and then we'll talk more in the morning."

Lo frowned a bit but it passed quickly.  "Lo, can you tell me about your bike ride in?"

Lo began to chatter about the bike ride, with Un asking periodic questions.  This was a standard practice when humans had to be brought in for any reason--Un had been doing it for a very long time and was known to have a light tough.  Lo was fine at first, effervescent nearly.  Then as Un decreased the delving, Lo became slower and less talkative until she finally seemed nearly dejected. 

It all went like normal, but there was something else about it as well. 

Lo had transferred her feelings back to Un, in some ways.  Un hadn't felt a genuine resonance with someone outside the Delvers in a very long time--it was uncommon for non-Delver adults to be able to affect a Delver, especially one of Un's abilities.  Un filed this information away--they'd been told Lo was special but nothing more; maybe this had something to do with it. As Un felt Lo's emotions begin to crash, he discretely dropped a pill in her next cup of tea. She needed rest. 

---

They had made this journey before.  They had made it so many times and hated it everytime. 

Fi preferred life outside the Well and now that her abilities were damaged she dreaded going back.  

She set her jaw as they strapped on their helmets and got on the bikes.  Lo noticed that Fi was nervous, or something--she seemed a bit distressed about something other, new. 

She knew she was supposed to love going back to the Well.  The Delvers all seemed to love the Well, but Fi had never liked it and the situation had only gotten worse.  At home she had friends who cared for her and they had space to live with the plants, to recharge between sessions.  At the Well, she was just one small part of a huge group, a detail only relevant when she was wrong or missing or out of place. 

As they pedaled she remembered when she first left the Well. She had loved it there as a child, or...well, it seemed to her at the time that she liked it but as she got older and had more control over her life, there were details that stood out.  

She remembered hiding. Hiding all the time, running from the more exuberant kids to get quiet time in the forest.  It felt a bit too on the nose when she thought of her current patterns.  She was a good Delver--or, she _had_ been before. But she needed more time to recharge. 

And there seemed to be something just a bit off.  They came together to sing songs about how every last person matters, but the truth was they didn't all matter.  Un and Mq loved the Well, they said it all the time--but they also loved being the center.  They loved knowing what everyone was up to more than they loved everyone. 

And Fi seemed to be the only one who could see it. The holiness of the Delvers, their role as Savior...it blinded non-Delvers to her unhappiness, to the corruption growing in their midst. (One of the Delvers has to be a betrayer)

She shook her head.  She was just in a bad mood. 

And yet she felt the need to prepare for the trip to the Well. She felt the usual detachment process begin.  She had tried in the past to stay open; she had the skills from her Delver past to control it.  She had stayed open. She had stayed present. But even that wasn't enough and eventually her mind would close, her eyes would constrict, her ears would stop listening and her body would take over. 

The last trip, after the incident, that had been entirely different.  She was so terrified that she had pushed as hard as she could to get there and her sensors were wide open, all defenses down. 

She'd never seen them see her through the lens of need.  They responded instinctively to her crisis and she remembered what she though the Delvers were supposed to be to each other.  Nurturers, care takers.  They took care of her for the better part of a week, helping her regain control of her senses, opening and closing her emotional apertures.  Her eyes had been a problem--the first person to greet her had been greatly damaged by the flood they received when they locked eyes with her--and they still hadn't managed to help her close them down.  She learned quickly to keep her glasses on, to avoid eye contact.  

And then it started slipping back.  They had a bigger crisis on their hands and she became someone to fetch things, to work, to get things done.  She was no longer particularly relevant.  [Ed Note: this much exposition is eyeroll-y. And difficult for me to write. Hopefully soon it can be actually good scenes instead?]

"What's it like there?" Lo's voice startled her out of her thoughts. She smirked a bit, since Lo couldn't see her face. 

"The Well?  It's..." The thoughts at the forefront of her mind were not what she wanted Lo to hear. She took a breath and let those concerns flow freely out of her. "It's lovely.  I love the ride there, have you been this way?"

"No, not very far. Only to the edge of town."

"Once you get out of town it's beautiful. The sky looks so much bigger as you go down into the valley and the clouds are always in crazy shapes...

"The Well is nice. I don't know what it will be like for you; we almost never have non-Delvers around. But it's a place of great warmth and welcome." 

"Who will I be meeting?"

"I don't know very much about the plans."

Lo didn't say what she thought but wondered why the person who had seen the vision had been sent to fetch her, but didn't know anything about the plans.  She got the sense Fi didn't feel entirely comfortable with the situation, either. 

"Is there any etiquette I need to know? I'd like to make a good impression."

"Un and Mq know about you, but in general things are pretty structured. They'll tell you where to be and when.

"I guess I'd only warn you that it is easy for them to effect you, obviously, and there's sort of a...calming cloud around the place. We tend the overall atmosphere to keep ourselves happy and harmonious, but I would be surprised if you don't feel it...too much.  You might be prepared to feel out of control."

Fi felt bad but didn't feel ready to share more than that.  She couldn't jeopardize the mission, even with her doubts. 

---

Time passed. They fell into silence again.  Fi noted gratefully the dried heads of a field of sunflowers she always looked for. They passed through a small town, mostly ruined, with a few houses that seemed to still have residents--a flat-roofed ranch house with a pumpkin carved and sitting on the steps,  a two-story Victorian with freshish paint on the gingerbread woodwork. 

"Who lives here?"

"I don't know...you know, I've passed through this village more times than I can count and I have never stopped. I've never seen anybody even walking around here.  We always stopped a bit farther--the halfway point."

Lo looked around...the houses seemed well cared for in the midst of crumbling buildings.  A wooden home was completely devoid of paint, the entire thing sagging and slanting off to the side.  The old post office was closed and boarded up.  They pedalled on. 

Fi was right--this was a beautiful ride.  She found something comforting with the soft grade down into the valley, the way the sky opened up above them, the distant ridge of a mountain blue, the land in front of it vaguely pink until it reached the greener base of the valley. A deer watched them from the trees.

At a wider spot in the road, Fi pulled off.  There was a shelter here over a table and picnic bench. Behind the shelter, a spring babbled over some rocks. 

"Here we are."  They stopped and pulled  food out of their bag--cheese, bread, dried meat.  Lo pulled out a jar of good mustard and started making sandwiches. Fi leaned over and stretched their hamstrings until Lo handed them a sandwich. 

"How are you doing, Fi? You seem stressed."

Fi flushed. They'd never been asked by a non-Delver how they were doing and it felt awful. It had to be related to their diminished abilities; they couldn't mask their feelings like they used to and now here was a non-Delver being affected by it. 

"Sorry, I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry." Lo could tell Fi was humiliated by the question.  She's been trying to help. 

They ate in silence, no traffic passing. The bright mustard was great with the fatty spiced salami, and Lo was hungry from the ride. 

"You know, I always wanted to be a Delver." Lo couldn't remember the last time she'd said that out loud--maybe when she met Io when they were 15. 

Fi looked up out of the corner of their eyes, mouth full, nodding encouragement. 

"Yeah, I always thought I'd be good at it."

Fi stayed quiet. 

"I mean, you can see it in my work, can't you? I feel like I've spent my whole life trying to learn what you've known since you were a child."

"It's not all that it looks like." Fi muttered quietly.

"I've been telling myself that my whole life: that it can't be as great as it seems. But it's hard to believe.  I have to learn the songs in my spare time, and I don't have anybody to sing with most of the time. I don't know why they didn't want me."  She drank some water. "But I've made my life anyhow."

"It's ultimately what we all do, isn't it?" Fi said it quietly.  "Shall we sing together? A song of thanks for the food and the ride?"

It was Lo's time to blush.  She'd sung with Delvers countless times but never just two of them at one time, alone.  She was always part of the larger crowd.  
"C'mon, it's fun. I won't be rude about it."

"What song?"  It was always the Delvers who chose the song. 

Fi started the song: 

Hot fire and warm fields of grain
Cool breeze and the glade
We are coming home
We are coming home to be Well

They repeated it twice before Lo joined in.  She didn't know this song, but it came easily to her. 

As soon as Fi could hear their two voices rising together, carried by the valley air, she realized she'd chosen the wrong song. This song was only for Delvers to sing, to sing as they came home to this particular Well.  But it wasn't the wrong song entirely.  

--
As they got closer, Fi could feel the change setting in.  Their attention span felt considerably shorter.  Their nose got stuffed up and their shoulders rose higher.  It was bad enough coming home before, but now...she could tell they weren't sure what to do about her. 

As soon as they got inside, Fi was dismissed to begin preparing the sleeping arrangements for the Well.  They glanced at Lo, worried that she would feel abandoned, but knew they couldn't give too much away or they'd risk punishment from Un or Mq. 

They remembered when they felt special for being close enough to know Un and Mq.  All their childhood they'd seen the leaders and wondered how she could be good enough to know them.  But now that they'd come closer to the leaders, they wished they were back on garden detail.
