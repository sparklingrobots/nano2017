SUMMARY: Lo & Su make a plan to deal with Io. 

The next morning Io slept til noon.  Lo went to Su's place after breakfast.  Her home was a tidy Victorian, mostly purple with some yellow and blue trim, a sunny spot in a neighborhood that was mostly overgrown.  Su's lawn was well kept, standing out as a spot of calm amidst the tangle of wilderness around.  She threw her bike against the porch wall and knocked. 

"Hey, Lo, what's up?"

"Do you have a minute?"

"Sure, come on in. I'm just doing some laundry." 

Lo entered and inhaled the warm scent of clean laundry.  Su's house was always so clean and calm it made her a touch envious. 

"So, what's up? I'll get you some water."

Lo didn't really feel comfortable talking about it.  What if she'd imagined it all? And, she realized the real fear: What if Su had turned too? Lo wasn't sure what she would do if her two best friends had both gone bad.  

But she also knew she couldn't move forward not knowing.  She had to take the risk. 

"Io is...something strange happened last night."

Su waited, in her practical and stern way. 

"They came home late last night and...I think they were drunk."

Su's eyes opened wider but she remained quiet. 

"They were...slurring and stumbling and..."

The fear settled in her stomach and she nearly couldn't say what she thought.  But she knew also that if it settled enough, she'd never get the words out.  So she rushed to it: 

"They ... they acted like they are one of the Bad Guys."

"What the fuck." Su's voice was perfectly still, almost glassy. 

Lo fumbled through the story: Io's drunken behavior, belligerence, intimidation, and then finally that weird little sentence: "We're going to win you know."

"And then I put them to bed and they fell asleep and as far as I can tell haven't been up since."

They sat together in silence.  Lo's stomach continued to churn, as she waited to find out what Su was thinking.  

It was a long wait until Su got up and stormed downstairs without a word. Lo waited a few seconds and then followed.  As she descended the stairs, she could hear soft padded thwacks and low grunts.  

She reached the basement and found Su punching a padded bag.  She didn't stop as she spoke to Lo, ragged from exertion but as cold and controlled as Lo had ever seen her be.  

"They can't have Io.

"They can't fucking have Io.

"Io was the nice one. The sweet one. Io was yours. 

Lo didn't know what to say but she felt the tears start to flow down her cheeks as she listened to Su's quiet voice. The sound of her fists pattered throughout the basement.  

Lo slumped against the support pole next to her.  She hadn't been willing or able to actually make the jump to the thought that Io might not be hers anymore.  She felt a flood of memories enter her: When they met, their first kiss, the time they fostered a kitten for a month.  Io had been always her quiet ally, her support in tough times. Io read poems to her every time the new moon came and cooked dinner. 

She didn't know how long she was there or when Su stopped punching.  She felt Su sit next to her and wrap her arms around her.  The relief that Su hadn't turned contrasted so much with the pain of Io's defection that she gasped as if she'd been thrown into a pool of cold water on a hot day. 

"Lo."

She tried to get her breathing under control.

"Lo, we need to finish the song.  It's the only way we can have any chance to get Io back."

Su. Su always with her pragmatism, her direct focus.  Su who loved Io almost as long as Lo had.  Su.  Su was always going to be the one to pull Lo out of this.  Only Su had the emotional stamina for this.  Lo felt so much gratitude to have her. 

She took a long deep breath, and felt a fresh wave of tears.

"Su, I can't. I can't do this without Io. Where will I live?"

"Shhh. Lo, we need to finish the song.  We need to finish the research.  We need to do it. 

TODO: Write about Io & Lo from before.
