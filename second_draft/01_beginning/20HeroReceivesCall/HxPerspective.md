Hx felt like shit. The smell of bacon cooking in the other room felt like a personal affront; a stomach-twisting insistence that they get up and interact like a normal human being despite feeling like a semi-murdered pile of dog shit. And yet. The obvious conclusion was they would be out of bed soon. They would be eating bacon. They would be pretending to be fine. 

With a stifled grunt, they swung their legs over the side of the bed. Looking down at their legs, they felt no surprise to realize they were wearing yesterday's clothing. A glass of water had been knocked off the bed stand in the night, water pooled in a bright little reflection on the wooden floor. They'd blame it on the cat if there was damage. 

Lo's voice, that deep scratchy voice she had in the morning, rose in a quiet hum over the snapping of grease. The song...the song was a sad song, Hx realized with a start. This isn't a funeral, Hx thought, though maybe I wish it were so I could be in bed.

They felt the sadness of her song creep into the room, sliding around the edges of the door. They could almost inhale the sadness, feel the coolness of it coming in and spreading. Who gave a fuck about the headache; Hx wanted a drink.

Hx didn't fall out of the bed, exactly, just kind of failed to stand up and ended up on hands and knees. The rising tide of self-loathing was incredible; their muscles barely could fight gravity in this dark fluid hatred. How were they supposed to eat bacon when this dark gaping void inside waited.
