SUMMARY: Fi receives a vision at the tree. 

THINGS THAT GOT LOST: 

_The history of the tree, the way the strangeness of the tree in its context obscured from her that true strangeness about it.  Something is hiding in this tree and she needs to know what.  (Alternatively she gets offed and somebody else figures it all out.)_

Fi recalled the meeting with Un that started this whole bizarre journey.

 Un didn't look up when he gave her the quest, just kept reading the report he had on his lap. He'd never been particularly warm, especially when working, but lately Fi had felt like a semi-intelligent piece of furniture when working.

"I need you to go to the spring."

She'd been tucking books back onto the shelves, thinking of how much she'd like to have her own collection of books, what if she'd been able to keep plant books with her all the time instead of having to go in and out of the library every time she wanted to look up a weed she'd found in a distant field? So the question caught her off guard. This wasn't the normal kind of work.

"There's been....there are some strange things happening, and with your plant thing, I thought you would probably be the best person for the job."

Plant thing. That's what Un called it. She kept her face still, knowing that Un wouldn't bother Delving her unless she was obviously upset.

"What kind of things? What ... when?"

Un finally looked up, eyes a bit unfocused from reading. He sighed and she blushed, feeling responsible for his frustration though she knew that was foolishness.  [Finish this story eventually, or whatever.] 

Fi felt shy, somehow, as she walked to the Spring.  She had ridden most of the way, but even the rough dirt track now covered in leaves stopped a ways from the spring. Most of the time there were hundreds of people here, tents stretching through the trees off into the distance, so nobody rode directly to the spring. 

She walked through the former campsites, a few signs of human occupation standing out--a few areas conspicuously cleared for tents, fire rings scattered about, a few bits of rope that had been tied to a rock and for some reason left behind. Fi found the left behind bits of rope a bit disturbing--why hadn't the occupants just untied the rope? Why waste the rope? It looked perfectly good to her.  

She walked on, leaving that rock behind. It was still early in the morning, she had camped quite close the night before so she'd have time to do the investigation in case it took longer than she expected. She heard some bird calls, and watched a squirrel dug under some leaves, making a cache for winter. 

The tree rose above her, finally. The water of the spring below was flat, with a slight ripple from the spring that came up straight from the ground.  She crouched near the edge of the spring, weight relaxed on her heels as she looked.  She wanted to swim in the spring, always had, though it was strictly forbidden and there was no way she'd risk the harvest for her silly impulses. There were other ponds in this world she could swim in without risk.  

She looked at the source of the spring for quite a while.  It had nothing to do with the research, but she found it so relaxing.  A small amount of sand rested on the bottom of the spring, though where it came from originally she had no idea--the ground around seemed much darker, richer than sand.  But down there, under the reflection of the tree, below her own face reflected on the surface, she saw the sand dancing where the water rose up from under the earth, pure and clear, filtered by the earth itself as it rose up from some invisible underground river. 

She found the cup, the old tin mug that someone had long ago tied to a bolt embedded in a nearby rock.  She gently scooped up some water, and drank it. It was just cold, fresh, water, but it had been a long day, and she was tired from walking.  They always drank from the spring when they came to visit so it seemed okay to her to do it now. More than okay it felt good, like it was only fair for her to get extra since she had to come out here. 

The story Un had told her scared her. A murder, a runway Delver, all happening right at the most delicate possible time.  Fi felt an extra attachment to the harvest, as one of the Greens she was in some small way responsible for it. And she felt it reminded everyone of the centrality of plant life in their world. People were so focused on the singing, the delving, the sound work...but it all came back here, to this small quiet bubbling place, underwater grasses growing and land grasses leaning over the bank, the bubbleweed growing in the water itself, the tree that somehow supported it all. So the issues they were having felt...kind of personal.  Like somebody was here to fuck up the plants situation that Fi spent so much time making sure was safe and plentiful. 

She looked up from the underwater grass, the unharvested bubbleweed they left so that the colony could regrow before the next harvest.  It looked so different at this phase--when the harvest was on, the entire surface of the water was covered with the bright green seeds of the grass as it floated on the surface, so thick it blocked the sun and threatened the ongoing survival of its own species.  Normal bubbleweed grew in flowing bodies of water, moving places, where the seeds would be carried away.  It never grew in stagnant water, still water--but then, the spring *wasn't* still. That motion down at the bottom, so small, almost imperceptible to a human eye except for the circling grains of sand at the bottom, was enough to convince the bubbleweed it could grow.

Fi had no idea how long they had been coming for the harvest, which long gone Green had discovered this rich cache and brought people here to do the harvesting, how long the whole town had gathered for it. But come they did, and they scooped up these tiny green five-sided seeds, bright and soft when still in the spring, though they quickly turned hard and sharp, light brown when they dried. And they did this every morning for a week, as they bubbleweed released thousands more seeds every night during the new moon. So they kept clearing the way, the seeds kept coming, and the bubbleweed lived longer, like it should have. 

Other places had bubbleweed, tried to use it the way the Delvers did, but it was so much harder to harvest as it washed away during the night. Nets, sure, but it just....something about this spring made the harvest exceptional.  Fi's personal theory was both the water flow change, and something else...the bubbleweed here was just happier. Wanted to grow thick and strong. She thought it had something to do with the big willow on the edge of the spring. It seemed, sometimes, as if they bubbleweed and the tree were at odds.  Were in some long battle, and the bubbleweed thought it could win if it grew more vigorously. 

She looked up at the tree, finally, realizing that she'd been avoiding it since she arrived. 

Fi felt stupid for not noticing before, the obvious strangeness of this tree. But she also intuited that the tree had been strange to her for years, and strange to others before.

Every time she'd been here before was during the harvest, or with other Greens here to support the bubble weed. Focused always on the weed, on how it was developing, the tree itself was just the backdrop.  Forests were hard for Fi, in general--well, not hard, but loud. A lot of information, chaotic and full of information. Not like a garden, where she could feel the patterns, where she had *created* the patterns. Here she might find a fern under another plant, hiding under a big oak.  It wasn't that she didn't expect it, but rather that there was always so much information and most of her attention was held by the bubbleweed. 

But now, here alone, the bubbleweed sleeping after the riotous release of the seeds, the rest of the forest going dormant for fall, it was a bit quieter, and she had the space to really look at the tree.

She had always found it strange to see this massive ancient creature in the middle of the younger forest, and she knew that it had likely survived even the Great Mourning. Through the Great Mourning that had taken out entire species, this tree had lived and grown. 

She knew trees like this tended to be planted by humans, at least the ones you found right on the edge of fresh water like this--this one was probably planted by the old Spanish missionaries. There was grieving and mourning in that story, too, in the disasters brought to her people, but she took a breath and accepted that the painful thing had happened and could not un-happen. It was a fundamental teaching: events cannot un-happen. The outcomes can be mended, they can be ignored, but the event cannot un-happen.  They hadn't yet learned the secrets of time, it still unspooled forward only.

When she looked at the tree, it looked like a big hulking thing, which was to be expected. Anyone could have seen that, especially now as it was backlit by the early afternoon sun. But she also saw strange patterns within it--as imperceptible as the source of the spring, really, invisible currents barely sensed even on this quiet day.  She looked at another tree, wanting to see if what she saw was the tree or, somehow, herself.  She turned her head toward an old elm, not old like the willow, but old nonetheless. It had a normal flow, water up from the earth, sun from the sky, she could see it breathing oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out, the capillary movement that moved things from head to foot and back again. The flows were a gentle green, and as she looked from tree to tree, she saw the same thing. One tree had an infection of some kind--she could see the flows were sluggish, and there was a graying around where the disease had entered through the thick bark. 

She looked back at the willow and felt again that something very, very strange was happening. Hard to say if it was good or bad, but it was energetic.  The same flows were there, but fast--they moved faster than any other trees. And she could see...was it pink? A fluorescent energy in the tree. There was something low in the tree, not an infection, something Fi had never seen before. It was only about three or four feet from the ground.  

Fi took some deep breaths, closing her eyes.  When the steadiness came on her, she looked again at the spot.  It was red, it looked almost hot to her. And in stead of the normal flow of a tree, there was that pink filigree climbing out of it, heading up and down.  She followed it up to the crown, realized a slight pink tinge to the breath of the the tree. And then she traced it down through the roots. 
She was shocked to realize that the pinkness extended down into the earth. She wasn't as good at looking through earth, so she sat with the tree the rest of the day. She delved into the tree's history in so many ways--tasting the bark, the leaves, the soil. She used her mind to speak with it. She danced with it, feeling the shift of the ground beneath her and learning more about the roots as they grew below the earth, forming firm and soft striations in the soil.
She was getting tired. She hadn't worked so closely with such a big plant in a long time. Trees--she loved trees, but they usually didn't need as much help, were strong from the get go, with lots of protection.  She looked down at the water again, letting her eyes rest--until she realized she was seeing pink in the water. She closed her eyes. Was it just a pattern burned into her eyes? She opened again and it was still there.  She could see, now that she knew it was there, the pink was not only in the water, but the bubble weed...the bubbleweed seemed to be interacting with this...whatever it was.  
Finally she got bold. She walked up to the tree. That red throbbing spot in the heart of it was only about the height of her solar plexus, after all.  As she drew close, she noticed sap slowly drifting down from the spot.  The sap, which with normal vision would be just a clear brown sticky fluid, looked to Fi almost like blood. Whatever was in the tree was coming out. It looked like perhaps a hole had been bored in the tree, long ago. Perhaps whatever she saw here had been put there purposefully? 
She couldn't prove it yet, but this pink...this pink didn't feel right. It wasn't an infection, at least not one she'd ever seen before. She would need to do a lot of research. She would need to talk to Un and see what he knew.  The regular green energy in the tree was too high, too--it wasn't right for a being this age to be moving so quickly. A young plant, sure, or in spring maybe she would see something close to this.  But in fall? It all seemed wrong and she grew afraid. Would the tree die? Was the tree ruining the harvest? 

[She thought of them arriving from Baja California, with wagons and burros, across the arid coastline. Finding the people here and finding their sacred spring and planting this tree here then.

Even as a symbol of conquest the tree was beloved, because trees are always beloved. And so the invader remained, a strange and massive reminder of the disruption of the Europeans coming to the Americas.

It grew, and grew. The water of the sacred spring bubbled up and fed the tree with its clear water. The roots of the tree spread out into the ponds of the spring, protected and living together with wild calla lillies and reeds. It grew and grew and the strangeness of it obscured its deeply held secret.]

She walked up to the spot, looked closely.  She reached out to the sap, and when her skin touched it, the secret took shape in her mind: There were seven dark, hooded figures gathered around the tree, the tree a flaming beacon--somehow both aflame and still living. THe city around was gone, the mountains in the near distance shrouded with marine mist. The animals around the seven were fearful but the figures themselves were unafraid.

The tree held great power. She needed to tell Un. It would save them all. She knew it.

She began to run out of the park and back to the house. She smiled, she laughed. Today was a good day. 

NOTES: I'm not sure she feels so good? She needs to be damaged by this, we don't actually have the scene yet where Fi gets broken and I think this is it. 
Additionally, later, she needs to realize that the damage in the tree is also (mabye) what makes the bubbleweed they have so strong, what gives them their power.  But how do we solve that? I'm not sure yet.

[A few meta thoughts as we begin: The tree may in fact be from another planet/culture/civilization.  The tree may be physically hiding something.  And the tree may be false--may be the secret will help the other side but our protagonist is unable to see it because she is so committed to plants and nature.  A Trojan horse ish thing.]
