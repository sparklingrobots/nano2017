Summary: Lo returns to singing, and Briony asks her to help the Delvers. 

 
Her music studies were going well, she thought to herself.  Not everyone would have been able to learn all these songs the way she had, mostly out of books and going to weird events where other music nerds would gather. 

She toyed with her dinner, a particular song stuck in her head: 

_Needing is one thing, and getting /
getting's another_

It was an old song.  It was from before and had nothing to do with anything else, but it's stuck in our writer's head and feels relevant. 

She had been specializing in the songs of extinction, lately.  There was an older person in town who got together with people once a month to sing those songs, songs of rage and fear and loss about the last elm tree, about the lost stripes of the tiger, about all the dead koalas.  The deeper you went the more you got into small creatures: The disappearance of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow, the battles against the zebra mussels and lion fish as they devoured ecosystems whole.  Bananas actually had an entire subgenre about them--songs about identical creatures being identically vulnerable, about banana splits.  One about the old joke about banana peels being slippery made her laugh particularly hard.

The building rose up above the others around it--not massive, but noticeably large.  The white roof capped a wall of colorful glass tiles, small squares of red, yellow, white, green, and so many blues that at a distance it mostly looked like the sky.  Large windows, placed irregularly in the north facing wall, watched Lo as she walked up to the familiar building. It was bigger than any other building in town, save a few of the larger apartment buildings. She could smell sesame oil and onions cooking somewhere near by. 

Warm air rushed over her as she entered the old church, drying her eyes enough to make her blink. Light came in, multi-colored and warm from the old stained glass.  The building was ancient, built in the middle 1900s, they said.  The windows were abstract, jagged slabs of colored glass high on the wall.  

Ahead of her, the small group had already started singing.  She slipped in, late as usual, pulling up a chair just outside of the main circle. She'd missed the last three weeks and they'd forgotten to leave a chair for her. She opened her mouth, singing along with them. A Delver--Ls, she thought--was preparing some tea off to the side while the rest of them sang. She liked to arrive late so there wasn't much time for talking in advance.  Even so, she could feel that strange plucking feeling inside her, the sign that a Delver was investigating her, looking for information.  She ignored it as best she could, letting the movement of air from her lungs be shaped by her mouth, letting that rush empty her of the worries she'd been carrying. 

For the next hour they sang together, with breaks for warm tea.  If anyone had bothered to look in, they'd have thought Lo just another member of the group.  The Delvers controlled the songs, most of which they knew by now.  Some were sung only during certain times of year.  

This week they had a new song. Lo recalled it, vaguely, but they had to go over the words together and practice a few times.  The harmonies were easy, each person slotting into the role they'd been singing since adolescence. 

Lo felt a wave of tears, unexpected, as they hit the bridge of the song.  The anxiety and worry she'd been carrying since the harvest seemed to amplify into terror, a quivering vein of emotion brought to the surface. She could see Ls watching her, but not Delving her.  Lo decided not to act in either direction. The Delvers had certainly delved the group as people arrived, had picked this song for a reason--she tried not to act suspicious. She was waiting, somehow, still for the news to be shared, for the community to come together and learn from the terrible things that had happened.  

From the corner of her eye she saw her neighbor's hand come up to her face. So she wasn't alone.  


At the church, they sang together.  They couldn't bring books or written versions of the songs from the library to the church, so when she found a new one at the library she was compelled to learn it herself, singing it over and over at home and on her bike until she could bring it to them.  Ml knew a lot of the songs and could help her when she fumbled. 

It was lovely, really, the singing of these songs together.  The churches were so resonant, absolutely the right place for singing of any kind, and the light streamed in on them.  Many weeks they wept together at the end.  


At the end of the recent session, as Lo sat and dried her face, Ml said to them: "This is why we sing.  We can't forget the pain.  And the music carries it to us, fresh as the day it was born. And we also have to remember how we handle the pain matters.  It matters to let it flow through us. The pain will always win if we don't let it flow."

She nodded. Her shoulders slumped and she felt tired.  The group of singers had gathered around her in silence, as they always did when someone was suffering extra. 

It was wise.  But it was hard.  

---

The singing was done for the day.  Lo could swear it had been more intense lately; she felt as if she'd been taking a brisk walk or something.  The songs were new, too; they felt...powerful in a different way. 

A figure entered Lo's peripheral vision as she sat, recovering from the last song.  It was Briony, clearly coming over for some kind of intense conversation.  She asked Lo if they could speak privately, and gestured towards the door the Delvers always came in through.  Lo, frowning, followed her into the back chamber. They had talked many times together before; Lo considered Briony something like a friend, as much of a friend as she could imagine being with any of the Delvers, but they'd never gone back into the heart of the building. Always they'd gone outside, on long rambling walks, talking about singing times, or books they'd read recently. 

The door led into a long hallway, with doors off the far side.  I nodded at another Delver as they headed back toward the singing hall, feeling awkward about being back here in the sacred areas.  Or I assume they are sacred, since I've never seen any non-Delvers back here.  The hall itself was non-descript, ceilings low, floor wooder and undecorated. 

Briony opened a door, just a plain wooden door, and she followed Lo into the room.  For all the nerves Lo felt, the room was fairly plain, not much to write home about.  Most of the light came from the windows.  There was a couch near the windows, nothing fancy--just a brown couch like any office might have (does Lo know much about offices?)  A small hexagonal table sat in the middle of the room with a potted plant growing riotously upon it.  Two low-slung wooden chairs faced the couch.  Briony started a small kettle boiling and gestured at the couch. I took a seat, gathering my sweater around me as I sat on the rough fabric.  What could Briony want to talk about, like this? Lo felt a shimmer of excitement, of hope--maybe the Delvers needed help with something. Organizing singing events. Maybe this was about the new songs they'd been singing? She quieted those thoughts. 

Briony looked steadily at me, glasses on, and I looked back at her, trying not to look too nervous.  A small tic seized her left cheek, the muscle twitch barely visible below the edge of the lenses.
"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today." 
I waited, knowing there had to be more to come.  Briony cleared her throat. "Tea?"
"Sure." I nodded and she got up to make the tea, pouring hot water from the kettle into two plain ceramic mugs, scooped tea leaves into small mesh balls, and submerged them. She handed me the mug on a small saucer and sat again. 
"Your singing lately has been lovely, by the way." 
I blushed, dammit, against my better judgment.  But the fact is I still look up to the Delvers so much that I can't really control my emotional reactions to praise. I suppose they know that, on some level, probably why she said it in the first place. 
"Lo, I've asked you here on behalf of the Council.  They...they have a favor to ask of you." 
I stayed quiet, stirred my tea a bit, and then looked back at Briony. "A favor? Hard to know what kind of favor I could do the Delvers." 
Briony wisely avoided the opening. She looked behind Lo, out the window, and removed the tea diffuser from the mug, dropping it to clatter on the saucer. 

"There's been an incident..."

Lo bit her lip. Were they talking about the...her mind shied away from the incident. She had been avoiding the memories since that day, occasionally seeing flashes of the scene, when a certain smell caught her--or when she heard the call of that bird that had woken her up. She should find out the name of that bird. 
Briony studied Lo, her eyes as they darted around the room. She could tell that Lo was...uncomfortable. If she didn't know better, she would think that Lo might even know what she was talking about.  

Lo felt the close observation, as if Briony's vision were almost able to caress her skin. It wasn't the same sensation as being delved, and she appreciated that Briony had so far left her that privacy.  Still, she steadied herself, pushed those emotions away again, let herself flood with awe of the Delvers, of the singing, to throw Briony off the track. 
Briony shook her head and started again. "There's been an incident.  I ask you to keep this in utmost secrecy as it is a matter of deep security for our community.  The Council of Delvers has asked me to invite you to the Well to...help us out with the situation."
"The...situation?" 
"Yes.  There have been some....strange occurrences lately.  There was....an incident at the spring during the preparations for the Seven Year Harvest.  And there are...reports from some of the border colonies that have the Delver Council concerned."
"Well, alright, but forgive me for wondering where I come into all of this.  I mean, you need me to fix a teapot or mend a sweater, sure, but this sounds...way out of my league."

"Lo, we need you to write a song for us.  I can't give you all the details, but the Council has decided the best way to calm the communities is via a new song.  Or perhaps an old song we've forgotten--nobody is quite sure what it will take."
Lo snorted and put her mug down with a rough bump. This was ridiculous.  This was offensive. 
She stood up, heart hammering, face flushed. It must be some cruel joke, some bizarre test. "Everyone knows that Delvers are the only ones who get to create new songs.  And you, of all people, should know how much I wish I was one of you.  You should know better than to ask me this...it's not funny, Briony." She remembered all the times she had come to Briony, offering to help transcribe or arrange the songs, and rage blew like a hot wind inside her.
She walked toward the door. 
"Lo, please." Briony's voice was shaking, enough to catch Lo's attention. The Delvers didn't show emotion often. "I know. I'm sorry. This is a real request.  We need you." 

Lo didn't respond. She put her hand on the door and turned the knob. She walked down the hall, back straight and tall, arms swinging at her side, thinking of nothing except getting out of here, going to the forest, and singing on her own.
