SUMMARY: Pale Man builds a device. 

He'd never been particularly mechanical but this little device had come together nearly on its own. Io, in particular, had been a help--sharing their mechanical knowledge.  Uo [or whatever his name is] could fix a bike or start a fire, but creativity in engineering was not his strong suit.  

He hadn't told Io what the point of the little device was, or who his target was.  He said he was making it to freak out the birds. Which was true--it was very likely going to freak out the birds. 

As they worked, trying different knobs and antenna lengths, they talked.  Uo asked Io abou their childhood, prying so gently at any small wounds until they were bleeding fresh.  Uo could tell by the usual signs, the heart rate elevated, the palms slightly sweaty.  But instead of his previous goals--to see that behavior and then reduce it -- he tried the opposite. 

It was, frankly, terrifying to see Io in that state of rage.  Io had almost never seen anyone so angry, even during training.  Io went from calm and helpful to irrationally angry, afraid of people coming for Lo, mad about sexual promiscuity (that had been a neat trick Io was particularly proud of) and nearly gleeful that the birds who heard this thing might fall from the sky.  
Uo had done good work here.  Now he just needed more people.
