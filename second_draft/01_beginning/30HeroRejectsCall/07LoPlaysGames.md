SUMMARY: Lo and Su play a game; Lo passes out from some effect of Bad Guys or Delvers.

She looked at the dice on the table and looked back at the map.  It all came down to this moment, or it would if things went well. If they went poorly, they had a few more hours of gaming ahead of them.  

Her back ached from standing and sitting.  She carried stress in the back of her pelvis and would need a good long stretch on the floor after this, but it was worth it.  They'd been going at it since 10 am and if she didn't win now, it was likely to go for hours and she'd lose.

She didn't hate to lose, but she wanted this one.  She felt it in her bones how much she wanted this one.  

She recounted her units.  She recounted Su's units.  Su was reckless. Lo was not, particularly, reckless.  She was not as decisively in front as she'd like to be, the element of chance still lurking over the moment.  But it was the right moment; she could close her eyes and remember the arc of the game--this was the peak.  It was time to risk everything.  

"I'm going to do it."

She moved her units into the space and grabbed the top of the box.  Together they counted the units, comparing strength; they counted nearby units for support.  They subtracted for punitive conditions; added bonuses for political strength. 

She threw the dice--a motley collection of bright colors ricocheting and spinning around the cardboard.  The last die spun for a good ten seconds, slowing so she could almost read which numbers flew by.  

The six came up. 

She threw her hands up and cheered. Su slammed a fist on the table and the cardboard squares slid off their little piles. 

She'd done it--she'd won women the right to vote! She burst into one of the old songs, while Su slumped in her chair.

It was an old design--one of the first wargames designed by women, from the early 21st century. Sort of an acquired taste compared to the more elegant and economical designs of the time--full of real people and real moments, balanced together to model the struggle of the suffragists in the early 1900s. It had been published and republished and passed down through the generations, and it was one of Lo's favorites.

The concept didn't make a ton of sense but it meshed so well as part of her studies that she couldn't resist.  There were even suffragette songs--not included in the original but added by a later party when the game was digitized.  

"You don't have to crow."

Lo grinned. "But I do, dear opponent."

Su rolled her eyes but smiled back.  "It IS part of the deal, I suppose."

Lo walked around the table and stuck her hand out in the ancient gesture of the handshake.  Su returned it, and then used Lo to pull herself up and give her a hug. 

They looked at the game together, Su's arm still collegially draped around Lo. 

"It's terrifying, isn't it."

Lo nodded. 

"I feel crazy but...Does it feel to you like those times are returning, somehow?"

Su didn't notice or acknowledge the look.  "I had a dream last night that the genders returned.  That there were some Bad Guys at work.  And in the midst of it all there was a great burning tree."

Lo looked sharply at Su.  She hadn't told anyone about the woman's vision.  It had been bothering her for the last week but she wasn't convinced any of it was real. 

"Tell me more about it," Lo said.  

"It was a really big, really old tree.  And it was...on fire? It was on fire and there were a bunch of us around it in robes.  And I felt this great....I don't know, it's impossible to describe but I felt this dark energy in the air, like an evil was coming out of the sky itself."

She paused for a long moment.  

"It was awful."

Lo turned and walked to the kitchen sink.  She positioned her glass under the silver neck of the faucet and turned the knob. Cool water flowed out into the glass but her hand was shaking trying to hold it there.  Su was still looking at the board, had moved to rearranging piles and trying to see where she might have salvaged a win. 

"Anyway, I'm sure it was nothing. I've just been anxious lately."

Lo put the glass down, worried that she would drop it. 


"Have you ever had that dream before?"

"Huh?"

"That dream about the tree, have you had it before?"

Su grunted. "No, not that I can recall. I can check my dream journals but I think I'd remember this one."

Lo put her weight on her hands and leaned into the cool stone of the cabinet.  These granite countertops had been outlawed for causing too much environmental damage, so they naturally became even more popular.  They were lucky to live in a house with one and Lo frequently pressed her palm to the surface to feel that cool smooth surface.  

She needed to tell Su what was up.   You can't save the world alone.  She knew it was true.  She had known it was true and she wasn't sure why she'd kept the secret except...something about the secret had asked to be kept. 

She returned to the table and started to pick up the pieces.  Her legs were suddenly so tired and she felt close to tears.  She picked up the small bag that held the Suffragist pieces, but staggered back into her chair.   The cat had taken up residence since she stood up and leapt clear with a quiet meow. 

Su was alarmed and stood up. "Lo!"

Lo closed her eyes as her head lolled back.  

The last thing she said was: "This is harder than I expected it to be."
