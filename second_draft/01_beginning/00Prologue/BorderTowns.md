 This town was always out on the edge. They had more visitors than the other towns, though none of them ever went out into the other places. They were more religious here than the other towns, somehow they know this about themselves.  

Whenever they came to the seven year harvest, there was always something upsetting from the other towns--they just didn't keep to the ways as closely as they should. They didn't sing as often together.  Okay so what happens, Tara? 

There are Delvers. They patrol their borders with psychic control, relying on obfuscation and intimidation more than brute strength--mind control really.  They do this to protect the people that they have managed to bring under their control.  They are essentially a cult that has grown bigger and more powerful into a full-blown society (though a smallish one). 

There are competing societies out there, or maybe not competing so much as co-existing.  The Delvers have a few who go out and test children, and bring them back to strengthen their own society.  These children are frequently not taken willingly but are kidnapped.  

There is a town that has figured out more or less what is happening, from a different society, and they decide that they will retaliate against the Delvers. Is this relevant? I start to feel as though perhaps we could skip on the external societies thing. I wanted originally to have some kind of menacing outside force but I think the Delvers can actually destroy themselves as is, they are already broken in two.
