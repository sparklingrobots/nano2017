SUMMARY: A Delver Goes Bad

He didn't go to the Well again. 

He could barely remember the strange vision of the night (?) before, only knew that he felt uncomfortable when he tried to think of that night or what came before. 

He felt lonely.  And angry.

When his neighbor came to borrow a book, he invited them in for tea.  They joined, glad to spend a bit of time with a friend.  And then he did what he wanted--he unfurled his abilities and pushed a little bit of fear into them as they talked about the Delver they'd seen that day, singing to a little girl on the side of the road.  He enjoyed watching their posture change as his emotions colored their own.  He'd always been good, so subtle that most people didn't notice the work he was doing on them.  

He went for a walk the next day.  He went to the market, felt the weaving of all the people coming and going, the knots formed everytime two people spoke--asking the price of two silvery fish, saying hello.  

He felt the Delver approach long before they got to the market.  He didn't have much time, so he took off his glasses and looked into the eyes of a passing parent with their child.  He encouraged them with his look to fear their child.  He could see them clasping the child's hand more closely. The Delver was getting close and some part of him knew that was going to be a bad scene. 

He turned down an alley and started walking quickly away. He bumped into someone walking the opposite way and they fell--then he felt a seizure in the web, the network. They'd sniffed him out; they'd sensed another Delver and the confluence of the disturbance and him...well, he guessed it made them nervous for him.  They were approaching more quickly and he felt a sense of nausea as they came closer--loathing that filled him up.  He started sprinting away, the people around him turning to gape at him like the wake of a boat on the water.  He needed them to ignore him if he was going to escape. 

The Delver was still seeking him, and then he felt another blip off to his right.  Was it possible they had summoned help?  He darted down a road to his left, bicycles swerving to avoid him. He knew a back way up here--an old road that had been divided into a bicycle path and a walking path, with the walking path splitting off into a separate wooded area.  And on the other side of the wooded area was his home.  He just needed to get clear of all these people and their feelings.  He started singing as he jogged along the path, a song of joy and companionship, hoping it would soothe the people around him, make them forget he had passed. It seemed to be working so he kept it up until the break in the path.  There wasn't much traffic and the Delvers had stopped their pursuit.  He slowed to a walk and stopped at a boulder next to the path to catch his breath.  He let his senses open up to sense as much as he could.  The surface of the community was normally like a calm pond to him; now it was a turbulent pond, water that had been disturbed by so many forces you couldn't tell the source of the disturbance.  He found it beautiful, energetic, the swirling and choppy flavor of the moment.  

It felt new and fresh, and it felt powerful.  He felt a future stretching out before him, very different from the old life.
