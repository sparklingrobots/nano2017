SUMMARY: The pale man becomes infected.

# SCENE: Write about when the tree released itself into the Bad Guys. 

Many many miles away a pale blond man sat at a table, reading a book on the thick slab of wood that formed the table's surface.  It was late, he'd avoided looking at the clock for a while now.  He had a cup of coffee near him.  He had a notebook open next to the book, taking notes on what he was reading.  It was a book he found in the back of the library and it seemed no one had read it in a very long time judging from the dust and the nearly immaculate but very brittle binding. 

It was a day like any Tuesday. He lived alone; he ate what he wanted when he wanted to.  He didn't have a lot of friends and his family was long gone.  He read most nights until 2 a.m. or so, feeling the coffee fill his stomach and warm him up.  
There was a flash in the distance bright enough to cast a shadow from his coffee cup for the two seconds it was lit--he looked up and could see a very large beacon of light off in the distance.  He could see it out the window of his third-floor apartment.  He stood up and walked over to the balcony, wondering if he'd see it again. 

For the better part of ten minutes he waited but nothing more happened.  The building he lived in was largely abandoned--he liked the quiet but now he wished he had a neighbor to confirm with. 

He sat back down and tried to get back to reading.  He sipped his coffee and started the page again.  

Maybe it was a strange form of lighting.  Or maybe someone had lit a bonfire?  He kept getting distracted by memories of the shadow of his coffee cup.  

It hadn't looked like what the shadow of a coffee cup should look like.  It had looked like a small creature was crawling on his desk--almost like it was crawling into his cup of coffee.

He scoffed to himself and went back to the book.  But he found himself reading the same paragraph three times. He couldn't keep his eyes off the coffee cup.  He picked it up and swished the cooling liquid in the cup. This was nonsense. He took another sip to prove to himself everything was fine and indeed, it was just a cup of lukewarm coffee. 

He decided he needed to get some sleep.  Maybe he should call somebody up in the morning--he'd been spending too much time alone.  His cat meowed at him from the doorframe and he took it as a sign. 

He did not notice the shape the coffee made as he poured it out into the kitchen sink--it looked uncannily like an old willow tree, frozen in that shape for a moment before the black liquid seeped down the drain.

His dreams that night were awful but not scary, somehow.  Everyone around him was afraid, it seemed, but they seemed to be afraid of him.  It was absurd.  They acted nice to his face but he could see the way they talked about him when they thought he wasn't looking.  He felt both immeasurably powerful and utterly powerless, a lone ship on a large sea, floating above it all but at the mercy of the elements, the fish, the loneliness. 

He awoke and lay in bed, looking at the dark ceiling.  The crickets had gone to sleep; everything was silent. He felt a fever coming on. That had to be what it was. 

---

He woke again, shivering and yet overheated. The sun was high in the sky.  His cat was hiding in the corner, utterly unwilling to come back by him. 

---

He awoke again. He didn't know what day it was but he was a new man.  He was a man.  He was awake and ready to take everything that belonged to him. He could tell he had changed. He had finally found the thing he'd been looking for; or perhaps it had finally found him.
